1	HOLT	Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.	0
2	HOLT	I'm Lester Holt, anchor of "NBC Nightly News."	0
3	HOLT	I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.	0
4	HOLT	The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.	0
5	HOLT	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.	0
6	HOLT	The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.	0
7	HOLT	The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.	0
8	HOLT	We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.	0
9	HOLT	At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.	0
10	HOLT	From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.	0
11	HOLT	The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.	0
12	HOLT	The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.	0
13	HOLT	I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.	0
14	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
15	CLINTON	How are you, Donald?	0
16	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
17	HOLT	Good luck to you.	0
18	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
19	HOLT	Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.	0
20	HOLT	We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.	0
21	HOLT	I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.	0
22	HOLT	Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.	0
23	HOLT	So, let's begin.	0
24	HOLT	We're calling this opening segment "Achieving Prosperity."	0
25	HOLT	And central to that is jobs.	0
26	HOLT	There are two economic realities in America today.	0
27	HOLT	There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.	0
28	HOLT	However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.	0
29	HOLT	Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?	0
30	CLINTON	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	0
31	CLINTON	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	0
32	CLINTON	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	0
33	CLINTON	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
34	CLINTON	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	0
35	CLINTON	I want us to invest in you.	0
36	CLINTON	I want us to invest in your future.	0
37	CLINTON	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0
38	CLINTON	We also have to make the economy fairer.	0
39	CLINTON	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
40	CLINTON	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	0
41	CLINTON	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	0
42	CLINTON	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
43	CLINTON	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.	0
44	CLINTON	So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.	0
45	CLINTON	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	0
46	CLINTON	How are we going to do it?	0
47	CLINTON	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
48	CLINTON	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	0
49	CLINTON	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	0
50	CLINTON	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	0
51	CLINTON	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
52	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
53	HOLT	Mr. Trump, the same question to you.	0
54	HOLT	It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.	0
55	HOLT	You have up to two minutes.	0
56	TRUMP	Thank you, Lester.	0
57	TRUMP	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	0
58	TRUMP	They're going to Mexico.	0
59	TRUMP	They're going to many other countries.	0
60	TRUMP	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	0
61	TRUMP	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	0
62	TRUMP	And we have a very good fight.	0
63	TRUMP	And we have a winning fight.	0
64	TRUMP	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	0
65	TRUMP	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	0
66	TRUMP	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	0
67	TRUMP	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	0
68	TRUMP	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	0
69	TRUMP	So Ford is leaving.	1
70	TRUMP	You see that, their small car division leaving.	1
71	TRUMP	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	1
72	TRUMP	They're all leaving.	0
73	TRUMP	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	0
74	TRUMP	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	0
75	TRUMP	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0
76	TRUMP	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	0
77	TRUMP	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	0
78	TRUMP	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	0
79	TRUMP	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	0
80	TRUMP	They're going to Mexico.	0
81	TRUMP	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	0
82	TRUMP	We cannot let it happen.	0
83	TRUMP	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	0
84	TRUMP	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	0
85	TRUMP	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	0
86	TRUMP	Companies will come.	0
87	TRUMP	They will build.	0
88	TRUMP	They will expand.	0
89	TRUMP	New companies will start.	0
90	TRUMP	And I look very, very much forward to doing it.	0
91	TRUMP	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	0
92	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?	0
93	CLINTON	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	0
94	CLINTON	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	0
95	CLINTON	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	0
96	CLINTON	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	0
97	CLINTON	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	0
98	CLINTON	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	0
99	CLINTON	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	0
100	CLINTON	That is not how we grow the economy.	0
101	CLINTON	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	0
102	CLINTON	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0
103	CLINTON	I understand that.	0
104	CLINTON	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	0
105	CLINTON	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	1
106	CLINTON	I don't buy that.	0
107	CLINTON	I have a different experience.	0
108	CLINTON	My father was a small-businessman.	0
109	CLINTON	He worked really hard.	0
110	CLINTON	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	0
111	CLINTON	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	0
112	CLINTON	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	0
113	HOLT	Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.	0
114	HOLT	You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.	0
115	HOLT	How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?	0
116	HOLT	How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?	0
117	TRUMP	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	1
118	TRUMP	Our country's in deep trouble.	0
119	TRUMP	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	0
120	TRUMP	They're the best, the best ever at it.	0
121	TRUMP	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	0
122	TRUMP	So we have to do that.	0
123	TRUMP	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	0
124	TRUMP	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	0
125	TRUMP	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	0
126	TRUMP	They have a VAT tax.	0
127	TRUMP	We're on a different system.	0
128	TRUMP	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	0
129	TRUMP	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	0
130	TRUMP	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	0
131	TRUMP	It's a defective agreement.	0
132	TRUMP	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	0
133	TRUMP	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	0
134	TRUMP	Good.	0
135	TRUMP	I want you to be very happy.	0
136	TRUMP	It's very important to me.	0
137	TRUMP	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	0
138	TRUMP	She's been doing this for 30 years.	0
139	TRUMP	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	0
140	TRUMP	The NAFTA agreement is defective.	0
141	TRUMP	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	0
142	HOLT	Let me interrupt just a moment, but...	0
143	TRUMP	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	0
144	TRUMP	They should have been doing this for years.	0
145	TRUMP	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	0
146	TRUMP	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	0
147	HOLT	Back to the question, though.	0
148	HOLT	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	0
149	HOLT	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	0
150	TRUMP	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	0
151	TRUMP	The companies are leaving.	0
152	TRUMP	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	0
153	TRUMP	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	0
154	TRUMP	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	0
155	TRUMP	We wish you a lot of luck.	0
156	TRUMP	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	0
157	TRUMP	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	0
158	TRUMP	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	0
159	TRUMP	We have to stop them from leaving.	0
160	TRUMP	And that's a big, big factor.	0
161	HOLT	Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.	0
162	CLINTON	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
163	CLINTON	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	0
164	CLINTON	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	0
165	CLINTON	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	0
166	CLINTON	He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."	0
167	CLINTON	Well, it did collapse.	0
168	TRUMP	That's called business, by the way.	0
169	CLINTON	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	0
170	CLINTON	Five million people lost their homes.	0
171	CLINTON	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	0
172	CLINTON	Now, we have come back from that abyss.	0
173	CLINTON	And it has not been easy.	0
174	CLINTON	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	0
175	CLINTON	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	1
176	CLINTON	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	1
177	CLINTON	Take clean energy.	0
178	CLINTON	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	0
179	CLINTON	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
180	CLINTON	I think it's real.	0
181	TRUMP	I did not.	0
182	TRUMP	I did not.	0
183	TRUMP	I do not say that.	0
184	CLINTON	I think science is real.	0
185	TRUMP	I do not say that.	0
186	CLINTON	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	0
187	CLINTON	And here's what we can do.	0
188	CLINTON	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	0
189	CLINTON	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	0
190	CLINTON	We can build a new modern electric grid.	0
191	CLINTON	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0
192	CLINTON	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	0
193	HOLT	Mr. Trump?	0
194	TRUMP	She talks about solar panels.	0
195	TRUMP	We invested in a solar company, our country.	0
196	TRUMP	That was a disaster.	0
197	TRUMP	They lost plenty of money on that one.	0
198	TRUMP	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	0
199	TRUMP	Our energy policies are a disaster.	0
200	TRUMP	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	0
201	TRUMP	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	0
202	TRUMP	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	0
203	TRUMP	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	0
204	TRUMP	So I will tell you this.	0
205	TRUMP	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
206	TRUMP	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	0
207	TRUMP	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	0
208	TRUMP	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	0
209	TRUMP	You've been doing this for 30 years.	0
210	TRUMP	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	0
211	TRUMP	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	0
212	CLINTON	Well, actually...	0
213	TRUMP	I will bring -- excuse me.	0
214	TRUMP	I will bring back jobs.	0
215	TRUMP	You can't bring back jobs.	0
216	CLINTON	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	0
217	TRUMP	Yeah, for 30 years.	0
218	CLINTON	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
219	CLINTON	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	0
220	CLINTON	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	0
221	TRUMP	Well, he approved NAFTA...	1
222	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
223	CLINTON	million new jobs, a balanced budget...	0
224	TRUMP	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	1
225	CLINTON	Incomes went up for everybody.	0
226	CLINTON	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	0
227	CLINTON	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	0
228	CLINTON	Will they create jobs in America?	0
229	CLINTON	Will they raise incomes in America?	0
230	CLINTON	And are they good for our national security?	0
231	CLINTON	Some of them I voted for.	0
232	CLINTON	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	0
233	CLINTON	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	0
234	CLINTON	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	0
235	CLINTON	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	0
236	CLINTON	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	0
237	CLINTON	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
238	CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	0
239	CLINTON	We increased them to China 50 percent.	0
240	CLINTON	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	0
241	HOLT	Very quickly...	0
242	TRUMP	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	0
243	CLINTON	Well, I've been a senator, Donald...	0
244	TRUMP	You haven't done it.	0
245	TRUMP	You haven't done it.	0
246	CLINTON	And I have been a secretary of state...	0
247	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
248	CLINTON	And I have done a lot...	0
249	TRUMP	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	1
250	CLINTON	Well, that's your opinion.	0
251	CLINTON	That is your opinion.	0
252	TRUMP	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	0
253	TRUMP	NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.	0
254	TRUMP	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
255	TRUMP	You were totally in favor of it.	0
256	TRUMP	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	0
257	TRUMP	But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.	0
258	TRUMP	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	0
259	CLINTON	Well, that is just not accurate.	0
260	CLINTON	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.	0
261	CLINTON	I wrote about that in...	0
262	TRUMP	You called it the gold standard.	1
263	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
264	TRUMP	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.	1
265	TRUMP	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.	1
266	CLINTON	No.	0
267	TRUMP	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	0
268	CLINTON	Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.	0
269	CLINTON	The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...	0
270	TRUMP	Not.	0
271	CLINTON	which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	0
272	CLINTON	I wrote about that in my book...	0
273	TRUMP	So is it President Obama's fault?	0
274	CLINTON	before you even announced.	0
275	TRUMP	Is it President Obama's fault?	0
276	CLINTON	Look, there are differences...	0
277	TRUMP	Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?	0
278	CLINTON	There are...	0
279	TRUMP	Because he's pushing it.	0
280	CLINTON	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	0
281	CLINTON	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.	0
282	CLINTON	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	0
283	TRUMP	But you have no plan.	0
284	CLINTON	But in -- oh, but I do.	0
285	TRUMP	Secretary, you have no plan.	0
286	CLINTON	In fact, I have written a book about it.	0
287	CLINTON	It's called "Stronger Together."	0
288	CLINTON	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	0
289	TRUMP	That's about all you've...	0
290	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
291	HOLT	Folks, we're going to...	0
292	CLINTON	or at an airport near you.	0
293	HOLT	We're going to move to...	0
294	CLINTON	But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.	0
295	CLINTON	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
296	CLINTON	So we have a very robust set of plans.	0
297	CLINTON	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	0
298	TRUMP	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	0
299	TRUMP	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.	0
300	TRUMP	You are going to drive business out.	0
301	TRUMP	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	0
302	TRUMP	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	0
303	TRUMP	I'm very proud of it.	0
304	TRUMP	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	0
305	TRUMP	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	0
306	TRUMP	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	0
307	TRUMP	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	0
308	TRUMP	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	0
309	TRUMP	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.	0
310	TRUMP	I'm going to cut regulations.	0
311	TRUMP	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
312	HOLT	Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment.	0
313	HOLT	We're going to talk taxes...	0
314	CLINTON	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	0
315	HOLT	Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.	0
316	CLINTON	I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...	0
317	TRUMP	Facts.	0
318	CLINTON	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	0
319	CLINTON	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	0
320	CLINTON	Because what I have proposed...	0
321	TRUMP	And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.	0
322	CLINTON	would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	0
323	CLINTON	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	0
324	CLINTON	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	0
325	CLINTON	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.	0
326	HOLT	Well, you just opened the next segment.	0
327	TRUMP	Well, could I just finish -- I think I...	0
328	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
329	HOLT	I'm going to give you a chance right here...	0
330	TRUMP	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	0
331	HOLT	with a new 15-minute segment...	0
332	TRUMP	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	0
333	HOLT	Mr. Trump, I'm going to...	0
334	TRUMP	And look at her website.	0
335	TRUMP	You know what?	0
336	TRUMP	It's no difference than this.	0
337	TRUMP	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	0
338	TRUMP	Just go to her website.	0
339	TRUMP	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.	0
340	TRUMP	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	0
341	HOLT	The next segment, we're continuing...	0
342	CLINTON	Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.	0
343	HOLT	achieving prosperity...	0
344	TRUMP	No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
345	CLINTON	No, we're not.	0
346	CLINTON	No, we're not.	0
347	TRUMP	See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
348	TRUMP	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.	0
349	CLINTON	That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.	0
350	HOLT	OK, you are unpacking a lot here.	0
351	HOLT	And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.	0
352	HOLT	And I want to talk about taxes.	0
353	HOLT	The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.	0
354	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.	0
355	HOLT	I'd like you to further defend that.	0
356	HOLT	And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.	0
357	HOLT	I'd like you to defend that.	0
358	HOLT	And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.	0
359	TRUMP	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	0
360	TRUMP	They're going to expand their companies.	0
361	TRUMP	They're going to do a tremendous job.	0
362	TRUMP	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	0
363	TRUMP	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	0
364	TRUMP	It's a great thing for the middle class.	0
365	TRUMP	It's a great thing for companies to expand.	0
366	TRUMP	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	0
367	TRUMP	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	0
368	TRUMP	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	0
369	TRUMP	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	0
370	TRUMP	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	0
371	TRUMP	And here's the thing.	0
372	TRUMP	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	0
373	TRUMP	I happen to think it's double that.	0
374	TRUMP	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	0
375	TRUMP	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	0
376	TRUMP	But we have no leadership.	0
377	TRUMP	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
378	HOLT	All right.	0
379	HOLT	You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.	0
380	CLINTON	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	0
381	TRUMP	Why not?	0
382	CLINTON	Why not?	0
383	CLINTON	Yeah, why not?	0
384	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
385	CLINTON	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	0
386	CLINTON	Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...	0
387	TRUMP	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.	0
388	HOLT	This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.	0
389	TRUMP	Yes.	0
390	CLINTON	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	0
391	CLINTON	We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
392	CLINTON	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	0
393	CLINTON	I happen to support that.	0
394	TRUMP	Then you didn't read it.	0
395	CLINTON	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	0
396	CLINTON	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	0
397	CLINTON	You've proposed an approach that has a...	0
398	TRUMP	Who gave it that name?	0
399	TRUMP	The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0
400	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
401	HOLT	Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.	0
402	CLINTON	$4 billion tax benefit for your family.	0
403	CLINTON	And when you look at what you are proposing...	0
404	TRUMP	How much?	0
405	TRUMP	How much for my family?	0
406	CLINTON	it is...	0
407	TRUMP	Lester, how much?	0
408	CLINTON	as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	0
409	CLINTON	Trickle-down did not work.	0
410	CLINTON	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	0
411	CLINTON	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	0
412	CLINTON	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	0
413	CLINTON	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	0
414	CLINTON	I don't think top-down works in America.	0
415	CLINTON	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	0
416	CLINTON	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	0
417	CLINTON	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	0
418	HOLT	Mr. Trump, we're...	0
419	TRUMP	Typical politician.	0
420	TRUMP	All talk, no action.	0
421	TRUMP	Sounds good, doesn't work.	0
422	TRUMP	Never going to happen.	0
423	TRUMP	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	0
424	TRUMP	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	0
425	TRUMP	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	0
426	TRUMP	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	0
427	TRUMP	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
428	TRUMP	And we better be awfully careful.	0
429	TRUMP	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	0
430	TRUMP	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	0
431	TRUMP	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	0
432	TRUMP	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	0
433	TRUMP	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	0
434	HOLT	Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.	0
435	HOLT	And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.	0
436	HOLT	Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?	0
437	TRUMP	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	0
438	TRUMP	And it'll be released.	0
439	TRUMP	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	0
440	TRUMP	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	0
441	TRUMP	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	0
442	TRUMP	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	0
443	TRUMP	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
444	TRUMP	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	1
445	TRUMP	You know what that is?	0
446	TRUMP	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
447	TRUMP	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
448	HOLT	The IRS says an audit...	0
449	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
450	HOLT	of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.	0
451	HOLT	And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...	0
452	TRUMP	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	0
453	TRUMP	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	0
454	TRUMP	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.	0
455	TRUMP	I said, do you get audited?	0
456	TRUMP	I get audited almost every year.	0
457	TRUMP	And in a way, I should be complaining.	0
458	TRUMP	I'm not even complaining.	0
459	TRUMP	I don't mind it.	0
460	TRUMP	It's almost become a way of life.	0
461	TRUMP	I get audited by the IRS.	0
462	TRUMP	But other people don't.	0
463	TRUMP	I will say this.	0
464	TRUMP	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	0
465	TRUMP	I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.	0
466	TRUMP	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	0
467	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
468	TRUMP	I will release my tax returns.	0
469	TRUMP	And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, "Don't do it."	0
470	TRUMP	I will tell you this.	0
471	TRUMP	No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.	0
472	TRUMP	Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.	0
473	TRUMP	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	0
474	TRUMP	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	0
475	HOLT	So it's negotiable?	0
476	TRUMP	It's not negotiable, no.	0
477	TRUMP	Let her release the e-mails.	0
478	TRUMP	Why did she delete 33,000...	0
479	HOLT	Well, I'll let her answer that.	0
480	HOLT	But let me just admonish the audience one more time.	0
481	HOLT	There was an agreement.	0
482	HOLT	We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.	0
483	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
484	CLINTON	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	0
485	CLINTON	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	0
486	CLINTON	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	0
487	CLINTON	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	0
488	CLINTON	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	0
489	CLINTON	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	0
490	CLINTON	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	0
491	CLINTON	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
492	CLINTON	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	0
493	CLINTON	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	1
494	TRUMP	That makes me smart.	0
495	CLINTON	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	0
496	CLINTON	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	0
497	CLINTON	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	0
498	CLINTON	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	0
499	CLINTON	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	0
500	CLINTON	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	0
501	CLINTON	And we'll guess.	0
502	CLINTON	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	0
503	CLINTON	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	0
504	CLINTON	Who does he owe money to?	0
505	CLINTON	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	0
506	HOLT	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.	0
507	HOLT	Do you want to respond to that?	0
508	CLINTON	I do.	0
509	CLINTON	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	0
510	TRUMP	That's for sure.	0
511	CLINTON	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	0
512	CLINTON	But I'm not going to make any excuses.	0
513	CLINTON	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	0
514	HOLT	Mr. Trump?	0
515	TRUMP	That was more than a mistake.	0
516	TRUMP	That was done purposely.	0
517	TRUMP	OK?	0
518	TRUMP	That was not a mistake.	0
519	TRUMP	That was done purposely.	0
520	TRUMP	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	0
521	TRUMP	And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.	0
522	TRUMP	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	1
523	TRUMP	That I can tell you.	0
524	TRUMP	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.	0
525	TRUMP	And you should go down and take a look at that.	0
526	TRUMP	The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.	0
527	TRUMP	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	0
528	TRUMP	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	0
529	TRUMP	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	0
530	TRUMP	And the $650 isn't even on that.	0
531	TRUMP	But it's not $650.	0
532	TRUMP	It's much less than that.	0
533	TRUMP	But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.	0
534	TRUMP	These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.	0
535	TRUMP	I could do that very quickly.	0
536	TRUMP	I am very underleveraged.	0
537	TRUMP	I have a great company.	0
538	TRUMP	I have a tremendous income.	0
539	TRUMP	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	0
540	TRUMP	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	0
541	TRUMP	When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.	0
542	TRUMP	Our airports are like from a third world country.	0
543	TRUMP	You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.	0
544	TRUMP	So the worst of all things has happened.	0
545	TRUMP	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	0
546	TRUMP	We haven't even started.	0
547	TRUMP	And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.	0
548	TRUMP	Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.	0
549	TRUMP	And it's really a shame.	0
550	TRUMP	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.	0
551	TRUMP	Our country has tremendous problems.	0
552	TRUMP	We're a debtor nation.	0
553	TRUMP	We're a serious debtor nation.	0
554	TRUMP	And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.	0
555	TRUMP	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	0
556	HOLT	We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.	0
557	CLINTON	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	0
558	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
559	CLINTON	And the other thing I think is important...	0
560	TRUMP	It would be squandered, too, believe me.	0
561	CLINTON	is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.	0
562	CLINTON	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	0
563	CLINTON	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	0
564	CLINTON	I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.	0
565	CLINTON	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	0
566	CLINTON	It's a beautiful facility.	0
567	CLINTON	It immediately was put to use.	0
568	CLINTON	And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...	0
569	TRUMP	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...	0
570	CLINTON	Well, to...	0
571	TRUMP	Which our country should do, too.	0
572	CLINTON	Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?	0
573	CLINTON	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	0
574	CLINTON	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	0
575	CLINTON	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
576	CLINTON	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.	0
577	CLINTON	You call yourself the King of Debt.	0
578	CLINTON	You talk about leverage.	0
579	CLINTON	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.	0
580	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
581	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
582	CLINTON	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	0
583	HOLT	Let's let Mr. Trump...	0
584	CLINTON	And we need to be very clear about that.	0
585	TRUMP	So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.	0
586	TRUMP	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	0
587	TRUMP	I built an unbelievable company.	0
588	TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.	0
589	TRUMP	It's an unbelievable company.	0
590	TRUMP	But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.	1
591	TRUMP	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	0
592	TRUMP	Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.	0
593	TRUMP	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.	0
594	TRUMP	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
595	TRUMP	And that's what I do.	0
596	TRUMP	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.	0
597	TRUMP	I'll give you an example.	0
598	TRUMP	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	0
599	TRUMP	But we're opening the Old Post Office.	0
600	TRUMP	Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.	0
601	TRUMP	I'm a year ahead of schedule.	0
602	TRUMP	And that's what this country should be doing.	0
603	TRUMP	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.	0
604	TRUMP	We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.	0
605	TRUMP	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	0
606	TRUMP	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	0
607	TRUMP	And we should be able to do that for our country.	0
608	HOLT	Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.	0
609	HOLT	We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.	0
610	HOLT	And let's start by talking about race.	0
611	HOLT	The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.	0
612	HOLT	Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.	0
613	HOLT	So how do you heal the divide?	0
614	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.	0
615	CLINTON	Well, you're right.	0
616	CLINTON	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	0
617	CLINTON	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	0
618	CLINTON	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	0
619	CLINTON	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	0
620	CLINTON	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	0
621	CLINTON	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
622	CLINTON	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	0
623	CLINTON	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
624	CLINTON	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	0
625	CLINTON	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	0
626	CLINTON	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	0
627	CLINTON	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	0
628	CLINTON	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	0
629	CLINTON	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	0
630	CLINTON	So we have to do two things, as I said.	0
631	CLINTON	We have to restore trust.	0
632	CLINTON	We have to work with the police.	0
633	CLINTON	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	0
634	CLINTON	And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.	0
635	HOLT	All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
636	HOLT	How do you heal the divide?	0
637	TRUMP	Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.	0
638	TRUMP	And we need law and order.	0
639	TRUMP	If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.	0
640	TRUMP	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	0
641	TRUMP	I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.	0
642	TRUMP	We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.	0
643	TRUMP	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.	0
644	TRUMP	You walk down the street, you get shot.	0
645	TRUMP	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.	0
646	TRUMP	Thousands of shootings.	0
647	TRUMP	And I'm saying, where is this?	0
648	TRUMP	Is this a war-torn country?	0
649	TRUMP	What are we doing?	0
650	TRUMP	And we have to stop the violence.	0
651	TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.	0
652	TRUMP	In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.	1
653	TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.	0
654	TRUMP	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	0
655	TRUMP	It brought the crime rate way down.	0
656	TRUMP	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.	0
657	TRUMP	We have gangs roaming the street.	0
658	TRUMP	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	0
659	TRUMP	And they have guns.	0
660	TRUMP	And they shoot people.	0
661	TRUMP	And we have to be very strong.	0
662	TRUMP	And we have to be very vigilant.	0
663	TRUMP	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	0
664	TRUMP	Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.	0
665	TRUMP	We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.	0
666	HOLT	Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.	0
667	HOLT	Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.	1
668	TRUMP	No, you're wrong.	0
669	TRUMP	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	0
670	TRUMP	It was taken away from her.	0
671	TRUMP	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	0
672	TRUMP	They would have won an appeal.	0
673	TRUMP	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.	0
674	HOLT	The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.	0
675	TRUMP	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	0
676	TRUMP	These are felons.	0
677	TRUMP	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	0
678	TRUMP	You need more police.	0
679	TRUMP	You need a better community, you know, relation.	0
680	TRUMP	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	0
681	TRUMP	It's terrible.	0
682	TRUMP	I have property there.	0
683	TRUMP	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.	0
684	TRUMP	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
685	TRUMP	You need better relationships.	0
686	TRUMP	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.	0
687	TRUMP	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	0
688	TRUMP	But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.	0
689	TRUMP	So there's some bad things going on.	0
690	TRUMP	Some really bad things.	0
691	HOLT	Secretary Clinton...	0
692	TRUMP	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	0
693	TRUMP	And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.	0
694	TRUMP	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	0
695	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
696	CLINTON	Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.	0
697	TRUMP	Ugh.	0
698	CLINTON	You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.	0
699	CLINTON	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.	0
700	CLINTON	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
701	CLINTON	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	0
702	CLINTON	Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	1
703	CLINTON	It did not do what it needed to do.	0
704	CLINTON	Now, I believe in community policing.	0
705	CLINTON	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.	0
706	CLINTON	Property crime is down 40 percent.	0
707	CLINTON	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	0
708	CLINTON	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.	0
709	CLINTON	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	0
710	CLINTON	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	0
711	CLINTON	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	0
712	CLINTON	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
713	CLINTON	We cannot just say law and order.	0
714	CLINTON	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	0
715	CLINTON	We need to have more second chance programs.	0
716	CLINTON	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.	0
717	CLINTON	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
718	CLINTON	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.	0
719	CLINTON	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
720	CLINTON	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	0
721	CLINTON	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	0
722	CLINTON	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
723	CLINTON	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	0
724	CLINTON	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
725	CLINTON	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	0
726	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.	0
727	HOLT	Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?	0
728	CLINTON	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	0
729	CLINTON	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	0
730	CLINTON	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
731	CLINTON	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	0
732	CLINTON	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	0
733	CLINTON	They admit it's an issue.	0
734	CLINTON	They've got a lot of concerns.	0
735	CLINTON	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	0
736	CLINTON	They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.	0
737	CLINTON	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	0
738	HOLT	Mr. Trump...	0
739	TRUMP	I'd like to respond to that.	0
740	HOLT	Please.	0
741	TRUMP	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	0
742	TRUMP	I agree with you.	0
743	TRUMP	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	0
744	TRUMP	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	0
745	TRUMP	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
746	TRUMP	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	0
747	TRUMP	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	0
748	TRUMP	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	0
749	TRUMP	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
750	TRUMP	I think you've apologized for it.	0
751	TRUMP	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	0
752	TRUMP	And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.	0
753	TRUMP	Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.	0
754	TRUMP	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	0
755	TRUMP	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	0
756	TRUMP	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	0
757	TRUMP	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	0
758	TRUMP	But we went from 2,200 to 500.	0
759	TRUMP	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	0
760	TRUMP	And it was terminated by current mayor.	0
761	TRUMP	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	0
762	TRUMP	Tremendous beyond belief.	0
763	TRUMP	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	0
764	TRUMP	It had a very, very big impact.	0
765	CLINTON	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	1
766	CLINTON	So there is...	0
767	TRUMP	No, you're wrong.	0
768	TRUMP	You're wrong.	0
769	CLINTON	No, I'm not.	0
770	TRUMP	Murders are up.	1
771	TRUMP	All right.	0
772	TRUMP	You check it.	0
773	CLINTON	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.	0
774	CLINTON	And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.	0
775	CLINTON	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
776	CLINTON	Look, one murder is too many.	0
777	CLINTON	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
778	CLINTON	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	0
779	CLINTON	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	0
780	CLINTON	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	0
781	CLINTON	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	0
782	HOLT	This conversation is about race.	0
783	HOLT	And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...	0
784	TRUMP	I'd like to just respond, if I might.	0
785	HOLT	Please -- 20 seconds.	0
786	TRUMP	I'd just like to respond.	0
787	HOLT	Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.	0
788	TRUMP	I will.	0
789	TRUMP	Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.	0
790	TRUMP	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	0
791	TRUMP	The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.	0
792	TRUMP	They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.	0
793	TRUMP	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.	0
794	HOLT	Mr. Trump, let me...	0
795	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
796	CLINTON	Well, I -- I do think...	0
797	TRUMP	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	0
798	TRUMP	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	0
799	TRUMP	But I will tell you, I've been all over.	0
800	TRUMP	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	0
801	TRUMP	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	0
802	HOLT	Mr. Trump, I...	0
803	CLINTON	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	0
804	CLINTON	And, yes, I did.	0
805	CLINTON	And you know what else I prepared for?	0
806	CLINTON	I prepared to be president.	0
807	CLINTON	And I think that's a good thing.	0
808	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
809	HOLT	Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.	0
810	HOLT	You questioned his legitimacy.	0
811	HOLT	In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.	0
812	HOLT	Can you tell us what took you so long?	0
813	TRUMP	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	0
814	TRUMP	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.	0
815	TRUMP	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	0
816	TRUMP	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	0
817	TRUMP	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.	1
818	TRUMP	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	1
819	TRUMP	They were pressing it very hard.	0
820	TRUMP	She failed to get the birth certificate.	0
821	TRUMP	When I got involved, I didn't fail.	0
822	TRUMP	I got him to give the birth certificate.	0
823	TRUMP	So I'm satisfied with it.	0
824	TRUMP	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.	0
825	HOLT	That was...	0
826	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
827	TRUMP	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	0
828	HOLT	I will let you respond.	0
829	HOLT	It's important.	0
830	HOLT	But I just want to get the answer here.	0
831	HOLT	The birth certificate was produced in 2011.	0
832	HOLT	You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...	0
833	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
834	HOLT	as recently as January.	0
835	HOLT	So the question is, what changed your mind?	0
836	TRUMP	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	0
837	TRUMP	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	0
838	TRUMP	But nobody was caring much about it.	0
839	TRUMP	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	0
840	TRUMP	And I think I did a good job.	0
841	TRUMP	Secretary Clinton also fought it.	0
842	TRUMP	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	0
843	TRUMP	Look, it's true.	0
844	TRUMP	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	1
845	TRUMP	And she was involved.	0
846	TRUMP	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	0
847	HOLT	I'm sorry.	0
848	HOLT	I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.	0
849	HOLT	But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.	0
850	HOLT	What do you say to Americans, people of color who...	0
851	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
852	TRUMP	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	0
853	TRUMP	I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.	0
854	TRUMP	He should have produced it a long time before.	0
855	TRUMP	I say nothing.	0
856	TRUMP	But let me just tell you.	0
857	TRUMP	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
858	TRUMP	I think you can see that.	0
859	TRUMP	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	0
860	TRUMP	And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.	0
861	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
862	CLINTON	Well, just listen to what you heard.	0
863	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
864	CLINTON	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	0
865	CLINTON	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
866	CLINTON	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	0
867	CLINTON	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	0
868	CLINTON	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	0
869	CLINTON	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	0
870	CLINTON	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	0
871	CLINTON	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	0
872	CLINTON	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	0
873	CLINTON	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	0
874	CLINTON	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	0
875	CLINTON	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	0
876	HOLT	Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.	0
877	TRUMP	I would love to respond.	0
878	TRUMP	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	0
879	TRUMP	You treated him with terrible disrespect.	0
880	TRUMP	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	0
881	TRUMP	It doesn't work that way.	0
882	TRUMP	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	0
883	TRUMP	I don't think you can deny that.	0
884	TRUMP	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	0
885	TRUMP	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	0
886	TRUMP	It really doesn't.	0
887	TRUMP	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	0
888	TRUMP	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	0
889	TRUMP	It was very easy to do.	0
890	TRUMP	I notice you bring that up a lot.	0
891	TRUMP	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	0
892	TRUMP	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	0
893	TRUMP	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	0
894	TRUMP	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	0
895	TRUMP	I'll go one step further.	0
896	TRUMP	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	0
897	TRUMP	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	0
898	TRUMP	And it's a tremendously successful club.	0
899	TRUMP	And I'm so glad I did it.	0
900	TRUMP	And I have been given great credit for what I did.	0
901	TRUMP	And I'm very, very proud of it.	0
902	TRUMP	And that's the way I feel.	0
903	TRUMP	That is the true way I feel.	0
904	HOLT	Our next segment is called "Securing America."	0
905	HOLT	We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.	0
906	HOLT	Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.	0
907	HOLT	So my question is, who's behind it?	0
908	HOLT	And how do we fight it?	0
909	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.	0
910	CLINTON	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	0
911	CLINTON	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	0
912	CLINTON	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	0
913	CLINTON	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	0
914	CLINTON	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	0
915	CLINTON	I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...	0
916	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
917	CLINTON	tough, long game here.	0
918	CLINTON	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	0
919	CLINTON	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	0
920	CLINTON	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	0
921	CLINTON	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	0
922	CLINTON	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	0
923	CLINTON	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	0
924	CLINTON	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
925	CLINTON	And the Russians need to understand that.	0
926	CLINTON	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	0
927	CLINTON	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	0
928	CLINTON	That is just unacceptable.	0
929	CLINTON	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	0
930	HOLT	Your two minutes have expired.	0
931	CLINTON	have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.	0
932	CLINTON	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.	0
933	HOLT	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.	0
934	HOLT	Who's behind it?	0
935	HOLT	And how do we fight it?	0
936	TRUMP	I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.	0
937	TRUMP	That just happened, and many more are coming.	0
938	TRUMP	And I'm very proud of it.	0
939	TRUMP	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	0
940	TRUMP	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	0
941	TRUMP	I was just endorsed by ICE.	0
942	TRUMP	I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.	0
943	TRUMP	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
944	TRUMP	OK?	0
945	TRUMP	Because look at the mess that we're in.	0
946	TRUMP	Look at the mess that we're in.	0
947	TRUMP	As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.	0
948	TRUMP	We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.	0
949	TRUMP	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	0
950	TRUMP	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	0
951	TRUMP	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	0
952	TRUMP	It could also be lots of other people.	0
953	TRUMP	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?	0
954	TRUMP	You don't know who broke in to DNC.	0
955	TRUMP	But what did we learn with DNC?	0
956	TRUMP	We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	0
957	TRUMP	Look what happened to her.	0
958	TRUMP	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.	0
959	TRUMP	That's what we learned.	0
960	TRUMP	Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.	0
961	TRUMP	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	0
962	TRUMP	ISIS.	0
963	TRUMP	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	0
964	TRUMP	It is -- it is a huge problem.	0
965	TRUMP	I have a son.	0
966	TRUMP	He's 10 years old.	0
967	TRUMP	He has computers.	0
968	TRUMP	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	0
969	TRUMP	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	0
970	TRUMP	And maybe it's hardly doable.	0
971	TRUMP	But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.	0
972	TRUMP	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.	0
973	TRUMP	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	0
974	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
975	CLINTON	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	0
976	CLINTON	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
977	CLINTON	It does involve going after them online.	0
978	CLINTON	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	0
979	CLINTON	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	0
980	CLINTON	We're making progress.	0
981	CLINTON	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	0
982	CLINTON	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	0
983	CLINTON	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	0
984	CLINTON	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	0
985	CLINTON	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	0
986	CLINTON	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	0
987	CLINTON	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	0
988	HOLT	You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.	0
989	HOLT	I'll ask this to both of you.	0
990	HOLT	Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?	0
991	TRUMP	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	0
992	TRUMP	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	0
993	TRUMP	We will take out ISIS.	0
994	TRUMP	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	0
995	TRUMP	And ISIS was formed.	0
996	TRUMP	So she talks about taking them out.	0
997	TRUMP	She's been doing it a long time.	0
998	TRUMP	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	0
999	TRUMP	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
1000	TRUMP	And then you wouldn't have had them.	0
1001	TRUMP	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	0
1002	TRUMP	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	1
1003	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
1004	CLINTON	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	0
1005	CLINTON	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	0
1006	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1007	CLINTON	That is absolutely proved over and over again.	0
1008	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1009	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1010	CLINTON	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	0
1011	CLINTON	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	0
1012	CLINTON	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0
1013	CLINTON	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	0
1014	CLINTON	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	0
1015	CLINTON	That's the most important part of this.	0
1016	CLINTON	How do we prevent attacks?	0
1017	CLINTON	How do we protect our people?	0
1018	CLINTON	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	0
1019	CLINTON	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	0
1020	CLINTON	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	0
1021	CLINTON	And they brought him down.	0
1022	CLINTON	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	0
1023	CLINTON	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	0
1024	CLINTON	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	0
1025	CLINTON	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	0
1026	CLINTON	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	0
1027	CLINTON	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	0
1028	CLINTON	They're on the front lines.	0
1029	CLINTON	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
1030	CLINTON	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	0
1031	HOLT	Mr. Trump...	0
1032	TRUMP	Well, I have to respond.	0
1033	HOLT	Please respond.	0
1034	TRUMP	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	0
1035	TRUMP	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	0
1036	TRUMP	Under your direction, to a large extent.	0
1037	TRUMP	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	0
1038	TRUMP	They were choking on the sanctions.	0
1039	TRUMP	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	0
1040	TRUMP	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	0
1041	TRUMP	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	0
1042	TRUMP	I did really well.	0
1043	TRUMP	But I have common sense.	0
1044	TRUMP	And I said, well, I'll tell you.	0
1045	TRUMP	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	0
1046	TRUMP	But two things.	0
1047	TRUMP	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	0
1048	TRUMP	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	0
1049	TRUMP	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	0
1050	TRUMP	And I was very strong.	0
1051	TRUMP	And I said it numerous times.	0
1052	TRUMP	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	0
1053	TRUMP	And I think that's great.	0
1054	TRUMP	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	0
1055	TRUMP	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
1056	TRUMP	But I'm all for NATO.	0
1057	TRUMP	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	0
1058	TRUMP	And they're going to do that.	0
1059	TRUMP	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	0
1060	TRUMP	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	1
1061	TRUMP	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	1
1062	TRUMP	Not only that, you named the day.	1
1063	TRUMP	They couldn't believe it.	0
1064	TRUMP	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	0
1065	TRUMP	They said...	0
1066	CLINTON	Lester, we've covered...	0
1067	TRUMP	No, wait a minute.	0
1068	CLINTON	We've covered this ground.	0
1069	TRUMP	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	0
1070	TRUMP	It should have never happened.	0
1071	TRUMP	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	0
1072	TRUMP	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	0
1073	TRUMP	Now it's in over 30 countries.	0
1074	TRUMP	And you're going to stop them?	0
1075	TRUMP	I don't think so.	0
1076	HOLT	Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.	0
1077	HOLT	You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.	0
1078	HOLT	What makes your...	0
1079	TRUMP	I did not support the war in Iraq.	0
1080	HOLT	In 2002...	0
1081	TRUMP	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	0
1082	HOLT	My question is, since you supported it...	0
1083	TRUMP	Just -- would you like to hear...	0
1084	HOLT	why is your -- why is your judgment...	0
1085	TRUMP	Wait a minute.	0
1086	TRUMP	I was against the war in Iraq.	1
1087	TRUMP	Just so you put it out.	0
1088	HOLT	The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...	0
1089	TRUMP	The record does not show that.	0
1090	HOLT	Why was -- is your judgment any...	0
1091	TRUMP	The record shows that I'm right.	0
1092	TRUMP	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	0
1093	TRUMP	Essentially.	0
1094	TRUMP	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	0
1095	TRUMP	We talked about the economy is more important.	0
1096	TRUMP	I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.	0
1097	TRUMP	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	0
1098	TRUMP	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	1
1099	HOLT	Why is your judgment better than...	0
1100	TRUMP	And when he -- excuse me.	0
1101	TRUMP	And that was before the war started.	0
1102	TRUMP	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	0
1103	TRUMP	I was against the war.	1
1104	TRUMP	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	0
1105	TRUMP	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	0
1106	TRUMP	But nobody called Sean Hannity.	0
1107	TRUMP	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	0
1108	TRUMP	I think in '04.	0
1109	TRUMP	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	0
1110	TRUMP	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	0
1111	TRUMP	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	0
1112	TRUMP	He and I used to have arguments about the war.	0
1113	TRUMP	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	0
1114	TRUMP	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
1115	TRUMP	And that's exactly what it's done.	0
1116	TRUMP	It's been a disaster.	0
1117	HOLT	My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...	0
1118	TRUMP	No, no.	0
1119	TRUMP	You didn't hear what I said.	0
1120	HOLT	Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?	0
1121	TRUMP	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	0
1122	TRUMP	There's no question about that.	0
1123	TRUMP	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
1124	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1125	TRUMP	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	0
1126	TRUMP	I have a winning temperament.	0
1127	TRUMP	I know how to win.	0
1128	TRUMP	She does not have a...	0
1129	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
1130	TRUMP	Wait.	0
1131	TRUMP	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	0
1132	TRUMP	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	0
1133	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
1134	CLINTON	Whew, OK.	0
1135	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1136	CLINTON	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	0
1137	CLINTON	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	0
1138	CLINTON	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	0
1139	CLINTON	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	0
1140	CLINTON	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	0
1141	CLINTON	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	0
1142	CLINTON	They had built covert facilities.	0
1143	CLINTON	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	0
1144	CLINTON	And we had sanctioned them.	0
1145	CLINTON	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	0
1146	CLINTON	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	0
1147	CLINTON	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	0
1148	CLINTON	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	0
1149	CLINTON	That's diplomacy.	0
1150	CLINTON	That's coalition-building.	0
1151	CLINTON	That's working with other nations.	0
1152	CLINTON	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	0
1153	CLINTON	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	0
1154	CLINTON	That's not good judgment.	0
1155	TRUMP	That would not start a war.	0
1156	CLINTON	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
1157	CLINTON	And the worst part...	0
1158	TRUMP	No, they were taunting us.	0
1159	CLINTON	of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	0
1160	CLINTON	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	0
1161	CLINTON	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
1162	CLINTON	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	0
1163	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1164	CLINTON	have a good time, folks.	0
1165	TRUMP	It's lies.	0
1166	CLINTON	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	0
1167	CLINTON	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	0
1168	CLINTON	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	0
1169	CLINTON	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	0
1170	TRUMP	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	0
1171	TRUMP	I would like to...	0
1172	CLINTON	It's a good one, though.	0
1173	CLINTON	It well describes the problem.	0
1174	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1175	TRUMP	It's not an accurate one at all.	0
1176	TRUMP	It's not an accurate one.	0
1177	TRUMP	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	0
1178	TRUMP	I agree with her on one thing.	0
1179	TRUMP	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	0
1180	TRUMP	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
1181	TRUMP	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	0
1182	TRUMP	They do not pay us.	0
1183	TRUMP	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	0
1184	TRUMP	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	0
1185	TRUMP	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	0
1186	TRUMP	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	0
1187	TRUMP	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	0
1188	HOLT	We need to move on.	0
1189	TRUMP	Well, wait, but it's very important.	0
1190	TRUMP	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	0
1191	TRUMP	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	0
1192	TRUMP	They have to help us out.	0
1193	HOLT	Our last...	0
1194	TRUMP	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	0
1195	TRUMP	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	0
1196	HOLT	Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.	0
1197	HOLT	On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.	0
1198	HOLT	Do you support the current policy?	0
1199	HOLT	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.	0
1200	TRUMP	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	0
1201	TRUMP	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	0
1202	TRUMP	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	0
1203	TRUMP	I looked the other night.	0
1204	TRUMP	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	0
1205	TRUMP	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
1206	TRUMP	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
1207	TRUMP	But I would certainly not do first strike.	0
1208	TRUMP	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	0
1209	TRUMP	At the same time, we have to be prepared.	0
1210	TRUMP	I can't take anything off the table.	0
1211	TRUMP	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0
1212	TRUMP	China should solve that problem for us.	0
1213	TRUMP	China should go into North Korea.	0
1214	TRUMP	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	0
1215	TRUMP	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	0
1216	TRUMP	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	0
1217	TRUMP	Iran has power over North Korea.	0
1218	TRUMP	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0
1219	TRUMP	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	0
1220	TRUMP	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	0
1221	TRUMP	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	0
1222	TRUMP	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	1
1223	TRUMP	Nobody's ever seen that before.	0
1224	TRUMP	That turned out to be wrong.	0
1225	TRUMP	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	1
1226	TRUMP	It certainly looks that way.	0
1227	TRUMP	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	0
1228	TRUMP	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
1229	TRUMP	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	0
1230	TRUMP	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	0
1231	HOLT	Your two minutes is expired.	0
1232	TRUMP	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	0
1233	TRUMP	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.	0
1234	TRUMP	Believe me, he's not a happy camper.	0
1235	HOLT	All right.	0
1236	HOLT	Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0
1237	CLINTON	Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.	0
1238	CLINTON	Words matter when you run for president.	0
1239	CLINTON	And they really matter when you are president.	0
1240	CLINTON	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.	0
1241	CLINTON	It is essential that America's word be good.	0
1242	CLINTON	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	0
1243	CLINTON	I've talked with a number of them.	0
1244	CLINTON	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	0
1245	CLINTON	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	0
1246	CLINTON	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.	0
1247	CLINTON	But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.	0
1248	CLINTON	And Donald never tells you what he would do.	0
1249	CLINTON	Would he have started a war?	0
1250	CLINTON	Would he have bombed Iran?	0
1251	CLINTON	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.	0
1252	CLINTON	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.	0
1253	CLINTON	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	0
1254	CLINTON	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	0
1255	CLINTON	People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.	0
1256	CLINTON	Can they rely on us?	0
1257	CLINTON	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?	0
1258	CLINTON	That's what I intend to do.	0
1259	CLINTON	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	0
1260	CLINTON	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	0
1261	HOLT	Your two minutes is...	0
1262	CLINTON	to be given any opportunities at all.	0
1263	HOLT	is expired.	0
1264	TRUMP	Lester, one thing I'd like to say.	0
1265	HOLT	Very quickly.	0
1266	HOLT	Twenty seconds.	0
1267	TRUMP	I will go very quickly.	0
1268	TRUMP	But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.	0
1269	TRUMP	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	0
1270	HOLT	Mr. Trump...	0
1271	TRUMP	And it's a big problem.	0
1272	TRUMP	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	0
1273	TRUMP	We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
1274	TRUMP	We cannot protect countries all over the world...	0
1275	HOLT	We have just...	0
1276	TRUMP	where they're not paying us what we need.	0
1277	HOLT	We have just a few final questions...	0
1278	TRUMP	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
1279	TRUMP	We need heart.	0
1280	TRUMP	We need a lot of things.	0
1281	TRUMP	But you have to have some basic ability.	0
1282	TRUMP	And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
1283	TRUMP	All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.	0
1284	TRUMP	But they weren't taken care of.	0
1285	TRUMP	And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.	0
1286	HOLT	Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.	0
1287	HOLT	Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, "a presidential look."	0
1288	HOLT	She's standing here right now.	0
1289	HOLT	What did you mean by that?	0
1290	TRUMP	She doesn't have the look.	0
1291	TRUMP	She doesn't have the stamina.	0
1292	TRUMP	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	0
1293	TRUMP	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	0
1294	TRUMP	To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.	0
1295	HOLT	The quote was, "I just don't think she has the presidential look."	0
1296	TRUMP	You have -- wait a minute.	0
1297	TRUMP	Wait a minute, Lester.	0
1298	TRUMP	You asked me a question.	0
1299	TRUMP	Did you ask me a question?	0
1300	TRUMP	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	0
1301	TRUMP	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.	0
1302	TRUMP	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	0
1303	TRUMP	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	0
1304	TRUMP	All you have to do is speak to them.	0
1305	TRUMP	Wait.	0
1306	TRUMP	You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.	0
1307	HOLT	Let's let her respond.	0
1308	CLINTON	Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.	0
1309	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1310	TRUMP	The world -- let me tell you.	0
1311	TRUMP	Let me tell you.	0
1312	TRUMP	Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.	0
1313	TRUMP	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
1314	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1315	TRUMP	But it's bad, bad experience.	0
1316	TRUMP	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	0
1317	TRUMP	I agree.	0
1318	TRUMP	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
1319	TRUMP	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	0
1320	HOLT	We are at -- we are at the final question.	0
1321	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1322	CLINTON	Well, one thing.	0
1323	CLINTON	One thing, Lester.	0
1324	HOLT	Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.	0
1325	CLINTON	You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.	0
1326	CLINTON	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	0
1327	TRUMP	I never said that.	0
1328	CLINTON	women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	1
1329	TRUMP	I didn't say that.	0
1330	CLINTON	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.	0
1331	CLINTON	He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.	0
1332	CLINTON	And he called this woman "Miss Piggy."	0
1333	CLINTON	Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina.	0
1334	CLINTON	Donald, she has a name.	0
1335	TRUMP	Where did you find this?	0
1336	TRUMP	Where did you find this?	0
1337	CLINTON	Her name is Alicia Machado.	0
1338	TRUMP	Where did you find this?	0
1339	CLINTON	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	0
1340	TRUMP	Oh, really?	0
1341	CLINTON	she's going to vote this November.	0
1342	TRUMP	OK, good.	0
1343	TRUMP	Let me just tell you...	0
1344	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1345	HOLT	Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...	0
1346	TRUMP	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	0
1347	TRUMP	Some of it's said in entertainment.	0
1348	TRUMP	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	0
1349	TRUMP	But you want to know the truth?	0
1350	TRUMP	I was going to say something...	0
1351	HOLT	Please very quickly.	0
1352	TRUMP	... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it.	0
1353	TRUMP	I just can't do it.	0
1354	TRUMP	It's inappropriate.	0
1355	TRUMP	It's not nice."	0
1356	TRUMP	But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.	0
1357	TRUMP	They're untrue.	0
1358	TRUMP	And they're misrepresentations.	0
1359	TRUMP	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
1360	TRUMP	And I don't deserve that.	0
1361	TRUMP	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	0
1362	TRUMP	It's hundreds of millions of ads.	0
1363	TRUMP	And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...	0
1364	HOLT	We have to move on to the final question.	0
1365	TRUMP	$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.	0
1366	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1367	HOLT	One of you will not win this election.	0
1368	HOLT	So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?	0
1369	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
1370	CLINTON	Well, I support our democracy.	0
1371	CLINTON	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	0
1372	CLINTON	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	0
1373	CLINTON	And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.	0
1374	CLINTON	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.	0
1375	CLINTON	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	0
1376	HOLT	Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question.	0
1377	HOLT	Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?	0
1378	TRUMP	I want to make America great again.	0
1379	TRUMP	We are a nation that is seriously troubled.	0
1380	TRUMP	We're losing our jobs.	0
1381	TRUMP	People are pouring into our country.	0
1382	TRUMP	The other day, we were deporting 800 people.	0
1383	TRUMP	And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.	0
1384	TRUMP	Ended up becoming citizens.	0
1385	TRUMP	And it was 800.	0
1386	TRUMP	And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.	0
1387	HOLT	Will you accept the outcome of the election?	0
1388	TRUMP	Look, here's the story.	0
1389	TRUMP	I want to make America great again.	0
1390	TRUMP	I'm going to be able to do it.	0
1391	TRUMP	I don't believe Hillary will.	0
1392	TRUMP	The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.	0
1393	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1394	HOLT	All right.	0
1395	HOLT	Well, that is going to do it for us.	0
1396	HOLT	That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.	0
1397	HOLT	We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.	0
1398	HOLT	The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.	0
1399	HOLT	The conversation will continue.	0
1400	HOLT	A reminder.	0
1401	HOLT	The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.	0
1402	HOLT	My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.	0
1403	HOLT	Good night, everyone.	0
1	RADDATZ	Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.	0
2	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
3	COOPER	Thank you very much for being here.	0
4	COOPER	We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.	0
5	COOPER	Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.	0
6	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.	0
7	COOPER	Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.	0
8	COOPER	Patrice?	0
9	QUESTION	Thank you, and good evening.	0
10	QUESTION	The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.	0
11	QUESTION	Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?	0
12	CLINTON	Well, thank you.	0
13	CLINTON	Are you a teacher?	0
14	CLINTON	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	0
15	CLINTON	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	0
16	CLINTON	And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.	0
17	CLINTON	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	0
18	CLINTON	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	0
19	CLINTON	That's why the slogan of my campaign is "Stronger Together," because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.	0
20	CLINTON	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	0
21	CLINTON	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	0
22	CLINTON	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	0
23	CLINTON	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	0
24	CLINTON	I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.	0
25	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
26	COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
27	TRUMP	Well, I actually agree with that.	0
28	TRUMP	I agree with everything she said.	0
29	TRUMP	I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.	0
30	TRUMP	This is a great country.	0
31	TRUMP	This is a great land.	0
32	TRUMP	I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.	0
33	TRUMP	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	0
34	TRUMP	And my whole concept was to make America great again.	0
35	TRUMP	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.	1
36	TRUMP	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.	0
37	TRUMP	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	1
38	TRUMP	In other words, trading with other countries.	0
39	TRUMP	We had an $800 billion deficit.	1
40	TRUMP	It's hard to believe.	0
41	TRUMP	Inconceivable.	0
42	TRUMP	You say who's making these deals?	0
43	TRUMP	We're going the make great deals.	0
44	TRUMP	We're going to have a strong border.	0
45	TRUMP	We're going to bring back law and order.	0
46	TRUMP	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	0
47	TRUMP	And this is happening on a weekly basis.	0
48	TRUMP	We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.	0
49	TRUMP	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	0
50	TRUMP	We need justice.	0
51	TRUMP	But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.	0
52	TRUMP	It's called make America great again.	0
53	COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
54	COOPER	The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?	0
55	COOPER	We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine.	0
56	COOPER	You called what you said locker room banter.	0
57	COOPER	You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.	0
58	COOPER	That is sexual assault.	0
59	COOPER	You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.	0
60	COOPER	Do you understand that?	0
61	TRUMP	No, I didn't say that at all.	0
62	TRUMP	I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.	0
63	TRUMP	I'm not proud of it.	0
64	TRUMP	I apologize to my family.	0
65	TRUMP	I apologize to the American people.	0
66	TRUMP	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	0
67	TRUMP	But this is locker room talk.	0
68	TRUMP	You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.	0
69	TRUMP	We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.	0
70	TRUMP	And they look and they see.	0
71	TRUMP	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	0
72	TRUMP	And they look at our country and they see what's going on.	0
73	TRUMP	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	0
74	TRUMP	I hate it.	0
75	TRUMP	But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.	0
76	TRUMP	I will knock the hell out of ISIS.	0
77	TRUMP	We're going to defeat ISIS.	0
78	TRUMP	ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.	0
79	TRUMP	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	0
80	COOPER	So, Mr. Trump...	0
81	TRUMP	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	0
82	COOPER	Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?	0
83	TRUMP	I have great respect for women.	0
84	TRUMP	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
85	COOPER	So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?	0
86	TRUMP	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	0
87	TRUMP	And I was embarrassed by it.	0
88	TRUMP	But I have tremendous respect for women.	0
89	COOPER	Have you ever done those things?	0
90	TRUMP	And women have respect for me.	0
91	TRUMP	And I will tell you: No, I have not.	0
92	TRUMP	And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.	0
93	TRUMP	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
94	TRUMP	People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.	0
95	TRUMP	We're going to make America safe again.	0
96	TRUMP	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	0
97	TRUMP	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	0
98	COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
99	TRUMP	Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.	0
100	COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
101	TRUMP	And that's what I want to talk about.	0
102	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?	0
103	CLINTON	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	0
104	CLINTON	You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.	0
105	CLINTON	Donald Trump is different.	0
106	CLINTON	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.	0
107	CLINTON	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	0
108	CLINTON	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	0
109	CLINTON	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	0
110	CLINTON	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.	0
111	CLINTON	Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.	0
112	CLINTON	We have seen him insult women.	0
113	CLINTON	We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.	0
114	CLINTON	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	0
115	CLINTON	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	0
116	CLINTON	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
117	CLINTON	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	0
118	CLINTON	So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
119	CLINTON	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	0
120	CLINTON	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
121	CLINTON	These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.	0
122	CLINTON	And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.	0
123	RADDATZ	And we want to get to some questions from online...	0
124	TRUMP	Am I allowed to respond to that?	0
125	TRUMP	I assume I am.	0
126	RADDATZ	Yes, you can respond to that.	0
127	TRUMP	It's just words, folks.	0
128	TRUMP	It's just words.	0
129	TRUMP	Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.	0
130	TRUMP	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	0
131	TRUMP	I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.	0
132	TRUMP	I'm going to help the African-Americans.	0
133	TRUMP	I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.	0
134	TRUMP	I am going to help the inner cities.	0
135	TRUMP	She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.	0
136	TRUMP	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	0
137	TRUMP	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	0
138	TRUMP	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	0
139	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.	0
140	TRUMP	So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?	0
141	RADDATZ	You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.	0
142	TRUMP	Sounds fair.	0
143	RADDATZ	This tape is generating intense interest.	0
144	RADDATZ	In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.	0
145	RADDATZ	As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.	0
146	RADDATZ	Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, "Trump says the campaign has changed him.	0
147	RADDATZ	When did that happen?"	0
148	RADDATZ	So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.	0
149	RADDATZ	When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?	0
150	RADDATZ	And you have two minutes for this.	0
151	TRUMP	It was locker room talk, as I told you.	0
152	TRUMP	That was locker room talk.	0
153	TRUMP	I'm not proud of it.	0
154	TRUMP	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	0
155	TRUMP	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	0
156	TRUMP	But that was something that happened.	0
157	TRUMP	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	0
158	TRUMP	Mine are words, and his was action.	0
159	TRUMP	His was what he's done to women.	0
160	TRUMP	There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.	0
161	TRUMP	So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.	1
162	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.	0
163	TRUMP	Four of them here tonight.	0
164	TRUMP	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	1
165	TRUMP	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	1
166	TRUMP	Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.	0
167	TRUMP	So don't tell me about words.	0
168	TRUMP	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	0
169	TRUMP	But it is things that people say.	0
170	TRUMP	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	0
171	TRUMP	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	0
172	TRUMP	Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.	0
173	TRUMP	And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.	0
174	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
175	RADDATZ	Can we please hold the applause?	0
176	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0
177	CLINTON	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	0
178	CLINTON	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.	0
179	CLINTON	Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.	0
180	CLINTON	When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.	0
181	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
182	CLINTON	And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.	0
183	CLINTON	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.	0
184	CLINTON	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	0
185	CLINTON	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	0
186	CLINTON	He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, "Mexican."	0
187	CLINTON	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	0
188	CLINTON	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.	0
189	CLINTON	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	0
190	TRUMP	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.	1
191	TRUMP	So you really owe him an apology.	0
192	TRUMP	You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.	0
193	TRUMP	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	0
194	TRUMP	Number two, Michelle Obama.	0
195	TRUMP	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.	0
196	TRUMP	And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.	0
197	TRUMP	So, you talk about friend?	0
198	TRUMP	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	0
199	TRUMP	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	0
200	TRUMP	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.	0
201	TRUMP	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	0
202	TRUMP	And I'll tell you what.	0
203	TRUMP	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
204	TRUMP	But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.	0
205	TRUMP	There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.	0
206	TRUMP	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	0
207	TRUMP	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	0
208	TRUMP	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
209	TRUMP	So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?	0
210	TRUMP	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.	0
211	TRUMP	And it's a disgrace.	0
212	TRUMP	And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.	0
213	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.	0
214	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
215	RADDATZ	I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.	0
216	CLINTON	because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	0
217	TRUMP	Oh, really?	0
218	CLINTON	In the first debate...	0
219	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
220	RADDATZ	And really, the audience needs to calm down here.	0
221	CLINTON	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	0
222	CLINTON	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	0
223	CLINTON	So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.	0
224	CLINTON	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
225	CLINTON	Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.	0
226	TRUMP	Because you'd be in jail.	0
227	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
228	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton...	0
229	COOPER	We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.	0
230	COOPER	Please do not applaud.	0
231	COOPER	You're just wasting time.	0
232	RADDATZ	And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.	0
233	RADDATZ	You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.	0
234	RADDATZ	You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, "extremely careless."	0
235	RADDATZ	The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.	0
236	RADDATZ	You don't call that extremely careless?	0
237	CLINTON	Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.	0
238	CLINTON	Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.	0
239	CLINTON	I'm not making any excuses.	0
240	CLINTON	It was a mistake.	0
241	CLINTON	And I am very sorry about that.	0
242	CLINTON	But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.	0
243	CLINTON	After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.	1
244	CLINTON	I take classified materials very seriously and always have.	0
245	CLINTON	When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.	0
246	CLINTON	Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.	0
247	CLINTON	So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.	0
248	CLINTON	And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.	0
249	RADDATZ	OK, we're going to move on.	0
250	TRUMP	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	0
251	TRUMP	Right?	0
252	TRUMP	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	0
253	TRUMP	You know, it's amazing.	0
254	TRUMP	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.	0
255	TRUMP	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	0
256	TRUMP	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	0
257	TRUMP	I don't think so.	0
258	TRUMP	She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.	0
259	TRUMP	Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.	0
260	TRUMP	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	0
261	TRUMP	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	0
262	TRUMP	That wasn't before.	0
263	TRUMP	That was after.	0
264	TRUMP	She got it from the United States Congress.	0
265	TRUMP	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	0
266	TRUMP	Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.	0
267	TRUMP	But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.	0
268	TRUMP	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	0
269	COOPER	We have to move on.	0
270	TRUMP	You did that.	0
271	TRUMP	Wait a minute.	0
272	TRUMP	One second.	0
273	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.	0
274	RADDATZ	We want to give the audience a chance.	0
275	TRUMP	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	0
276	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you can respond.	0
277	COOPER	Then we have to move on to an audience question.	0
278	CLINTON	Look, it's just not true.	0
279	CLINTON	And so please, go to...	0
280	TRUMP	Oh, you didn't delete them?	0
281	COOPER	Allow her to respond, please.	0
282	CLINTON	It was personal e-mails, not official.	0
283	TRUMP	Oh, 33,000?	0
284	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
285	CLINTON	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	0
286	TRUMP	Oh, yeah.	0
287	TRUMP	What about the other 15,000?	0
288	COOPER	Please allow her to respond.	0
289	COOPER	She didn't talk while you talked.	0
290	CLINTON	Yes, that's true, I didn't.	0
291	TRUMP	Because you have nothing to say.	0
292	CLINTON	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	0
293	TRUMP	Get off this question.	0
294	CLINTON	OK, Donald.	0
295	CLINTON	I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.	0
296	CLINTON	But let's at least focus...	0
297	TRUMP	Let's see what happens...	0
298	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
299	COOPER	Allow her to respond.	0
300	CLINTON	on some of the issues that people care about tonight.	0
301	CLINTON	Let's get to their questions.	0
302	COOPER	We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.	0
303	COOPER	He has a question about health care.	0
304	COOPER	Ken?	0
305	TRUMP	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	0
306	TRUMP	I'd like to know.	0
307	TRUMP	Why aren't you bringing...	0
308	COOPER	We brought up the e-mails.	0
309	TRUMP	No, it hasn't.	0
310	TRUMP	It hasn't.	0
311	TRUMP	And it hasn't been finished at all.	0
312	COOPER	Ken Karpowicz has a question.	0
313	TRUMP	It's nice to -- one on three.	0
314	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
315	QUESTION	Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.	0
316	QUESTION	Premiums have gone up.	0
317	QUESTION	Deductibles have gone up.	0
318	QUESTION	Copays have gone up.	0
319	QUESTION	Prescriptions have gone up.	0
320	QUESTION	And the coverage has gone down.	0
321	QUESTION	What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?	0
322	COOPER	That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.	0
323	CLINTON	If he wants to start, he can start.	0
324	CLINTON	No, go ahead, Donald.	0
325	TRUMP	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	0
326	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
327	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
328	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?	0
329	CLINTON	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
330	CLINTON	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	0
331	CLINTON	Premiums have gotten too high.	0
332	CLINTON	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	0
333	CLINTON	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	0
334	CLINTON	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	0
335	CLINTON	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	0
336	CLINTON	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	0
337	CLINTON	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	0
338	CLINTON	Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.	0
339	CLINTON	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	0
340	CLINTON	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	1
341	CLINTON	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
342	CLINTON	But we've got to get costs down.	0
343	CLINTON	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	0
344	CLINTON	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	0
345	CLINTON	And then we would have to start all over again.	0
346	CLINTON	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	0
347	CLINTON	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	0
348	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, your time is up.	0
349	CLINTON	So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.	0
350	COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
351	TRUMP	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	0
352	TRUMP	Obamacare is a disaster.	0
353	TRUMP	You know it.	0
354	TRUMP	We all know it.	0
355	TRUMP	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.	0
356	TRUMP	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.	0
357	TRUMP	It's only getting worse.	0
358	TRUMP	In '17, it implodes by itself.	0
359	TRUMP	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	0
360	TRUMP	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	0
361	TRUMP	Obamacare will never work.	0
362	TRUMP	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	0
363	TRUMP	Far too expensive.	0
364	TRUMP	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	0
365	TRUMP	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.	0
366	TRUMP	We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.	0
367	TRUMP	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	0
368	TRUMP	We want competition.	0
369	TRUMP	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	0
370	TRUMP	She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.	1
371	TRUMP	And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.	0
372	TRUMP	It's catastrophic in certain ways.	0
373	TRUMP	But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.	0
374	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.	0
375	TRUMP	Obamacare was the first step.	0
376	TRUMP	Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
377	TRUMP	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	0
378	COOPER	Mr. Trump, your time...	0
379	TRUMP	It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.	0
380	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.	0
381	COOPER	Your husband called Obamacare, quote, "the craziest thing in the world," saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half.	0
382	COOPER	Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?	0
383	CLINTON	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	0
384	CLINTON	And it's very clear.	0
385	CLINTON	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	0
386	CLINTON	But we have an employer-based system.	0
387	CLINTON	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	0
388	CLINTON	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	0
389	CLINTON	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	0
390	CLINTON	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.	0
391	CLINTON	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	0
392	CLINTON	So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...	0
393	COOPER	Secretary Clinton...	0
394	CLINTON	get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	0
395	COOPER	Your time is up.	0
396	CLINTON	you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.	0
397	CLINTON	So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
398	CLINTON	That's not going to work.	0
399	COOPER	Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.	0
400	TRUMP	Well, I just want -- just one thing.	0
401	TRUMP	First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.	0
402	TRUMP	Everything.	0
403	TRUMP	Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.	0
404	TRUMP	This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.	0
405	COOPER	You've said you want to end Obamacare...	0
406	TRUMP	By the way...	0
407	COOPER	You've said you want to end Obamacare.	0
408	COOPER	You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.	0
409	COOPER	How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?	0
410	TRUMP	We're going to be able to.	0
411	TRUMP	You're going to have plans...	0
412	COOPER	What does that mean?	0
413	TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	0
414	TRUMP	You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.	0
415	TRUMP	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	0
416	COOPER	Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?	0
417	TRUMP	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	0
418	TRUMP	President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.	0
419	TRUMP	You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.	0
420	TRUMP	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	0
421	TRUMP	The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.	0
422	TRUMP	But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.	0
423	TRUMP	And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.	0
424	TRUMP	We're going to block grant into the states.	0
425	TRUMP	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...	0
426	COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
427	TRUMP	so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.	0
428	COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
429	RADDATZ	We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.	0
430	QUESTION	Hi.	0
431	QUESTION	There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.	0
432	QUESTION	You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?	0
433	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, you're first.	0
434	TRUMP	Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.	0
435	TRUMP	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	0
436	TRUMP	I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.	0
437	TRUMP	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	0
438	TRUMP	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	0
439	TRUMP	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
440	TRUMP	Horribly wounded.	0
441	TRUMP	They'll never be the same.	0
442	TRUMP	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	0
443	TRUMP	And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.	0
444	TRUMP	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	0
445	TRUMP	Go outside.	0
446	TRUMP	Look at Paris.	0
447	TRUMP	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	0
448	TRUMP	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.	0
449	TRUMP	He won't use the term "radical Islamic terrorism."	0
450	TRUMP	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
451	TRUMP	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	0
452	TRUMP	But the name is there.	0
453	TRUMP	It's radical Islamic terror.	0
454	TRUMP	And before you solve it, you have to say the name.	0
455	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton?	0
456	CLINTON	Well, thank you for asking your question.	0
457	CLINTON	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	0
458	CLINTON	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	0
459	CLINTON	I want to say just a couple of things.	0
460	CLINTON	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	0
461	CLINTON	And we've had many successful Muslims.	0
462	CLINTON	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	0
463	CLINTON	My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.	0
464	CLINTON	That's what America is.	0
465	CLINTON	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	0
466	CLINTON	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.	0
467	CLINTON	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	0
468	CLINTON	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	0
469	CLINTON	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	0
470	CLINTON	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	0
471	CLINTON	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	0
472	CLINTON	And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.	0
473	CLINTON	We are not at war with Islam.	0
474	CLINTON	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	0
475	CLINTON	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.	0
476	RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
477	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, in December, you said this.	0
478	RADDATZ	Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.	0
479	RADDATZ	We have no choice.	0
480	RADDATZ	We have no choice.	0
481	RADDATZ	Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.	0
482	RADDATZ	Is that correct?	0
483	RADDATZ	And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?	0
484	TRUMP	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	0
485	TRUMP	Iraq was disaster.	0
486	TRUMP	So he would have been alive today.	0
487	TRUMP	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	0
488	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
489	TRUMP	Excuse me..	0
490	RADDATZ	And why did it morph into that?	0
491	RADDATZ	No, did you -- no, answer the question.	0
492	RADDATZ	Do you still believe...	0
493	TRUMP	Why don't you interrupt her?	0
494	TRUMP	You interrupt me all the time.	0
495	RADDATZ	I do.	0
496	TRUMP	Why don't you interrupt her?	0
497	RADDATZ	Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?	0
498	TRUMP	It's called extreme vetting.	0
499	TRUMP	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.	0
500	TRUMP	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	0
501	TRUMP	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	0
502	TRUMP	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.	0
503	TRUMP	We have enough problems in this country.	0
504	TRUMP	I believe in building safe zones.	0
505	TRUMP	I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.	0
506	TRUMP	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	0
507	TRUMP	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.	0
508	RADDATZ	And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.	0
509	RADDATZ	We know you want tougher vetting.	0
510	RADDATZ	That's not a perfect system.	0
511	RADDATZ	So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?	0
512	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	0
513	CLINTON	But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.	0
514	CLINTON	There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.	0
515	CLINTON	And we need to do our part.	0
516	CLINTON	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.	0
517	CLINTON	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	0
518	CLINTON	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	0
519	CLINTON	How do you do that?	0
520	CLINTON	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.	0
521	CLINTON	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	0
522	CLINTON	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	0
523	CLINTON	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	0
524	CLINTON	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.	0
525	CLINTON	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.	0
526	CLINTON	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	0
527	CLINTON	We have it on tape.	0
528	CLINTON	The entire press corps has looked at it.	0
529	CLINTON	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	0
530	TRUMP	That's not been debunked.	0
531	CLINTON	So, please...	0
532	TRUMP	That has not been debunked.	0
533	CLINTON	go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.	0
534	TRUMP	I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.	1
535	TRUMP	Has not been debunked.	0
536	TRUMP	And you voted for it.	0
537	TRUMP	And you shouldn't have.	0
538	TRUMP	Well, I just want to say...	0
539	RADDATZ	There's been lots of fact-checking on that.	0
540	RADDATZ	I'd like to move on to an online question...	0
541	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
542	TRUMP	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	0
543	RADDATZ	She did not.	0
544	TRUMP	Could I just respond to this, please?	0
545	RADDATZ	Very quickly, please.	0
546	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.	0
547	TRUMP	When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.	0
548	TRUMP	In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.	0
549	TRUMP	And they don't want them.	0
550	TRUMP	And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.	0
551	TRUMP	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
552	TRUMP	They're murderers and some very bad people.	0
553	TRUMP	And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.	0
554	TRUMP	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	0
555	TRUMP	At a record clip.	0
556	TRUMP	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	0
557	TRUMP	ICE just endorsed me.	0
558	TRUMP	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	0
559	TRUMP	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	0
560	TRUMP	She doesn't.	0
561	TRUMP	She wants amnesty for everybody.	0
562	TRUMP	Come right in.	0
563	TRUMP	Come right over.	0
564	TRUMP	It's a horrible thing she's doing.	0
565	TRUMP	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
566	TRUMP	That I can tell you.	0
567	RADDATZ	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
568	RADDATZ	I want to move on.	0
569	RADDATZ	This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes.	0
570	RADDATZ	This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.	0
571	RADDATZ	So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?	0
572	RADDATZ	Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?	0
573	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.	0
574	CLINTON	Well, right.	0
575	CLINTON	As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called "Lincoln."	0
576	CLINTON	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.	0
577	CLINTON	It was principled, and it was strategic.	0
578	CLINTON	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.	0
579	CLINTON	And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.	0
580	CLINTON	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	0
581	CLINTON	But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.	0
582	CLINTON	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	0
583	CLINTON	We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.	0
584	CLINTON	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	0
585	CLINTON	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.	0
586	CLINTON	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	0
587	CLINTON	But we deserve answers.	0
588	CLINTON	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...	0
589	RADDATZ	We're going to get to that later.	0
590	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you're out of time.	0
591	CLINTON	with the Russians and other foreign powers.	0
592	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?	0
593	TRUMP	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
594	TRUMP	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
595	TRUMP	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	0
596	TRUMP	And she lied.	0
597	TRUMP	Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.	0
598	TRUMP	That's one that I haven't...	0
599	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
600	TRUMP	OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.	0
601	TRUMP	That's the good thing.	0
602	TRUMP	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	0
603	TRUMP	That's a big, big difference.	0
604	TRUMP	We're talking about some difference.	0
605	TRUMP	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.	0
606	TRUMP	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
607	TRUMP	But I don't know Putin.	0
608	TRUMP	But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.	1
609	TRUMP	Maybe there is no hacking.	0
610	TRUMP	But they always blame Russia.	0
611	TRUMP	And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.	0
612	TRUMP	I know nothing about Russia.	0
613	TRUMP	I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.	0
614	TRUMP	I don't deal there.	0
615	TRUMP	I have no businesses there.	0
616	TRUMP	I have no loans from Russia.	0
617	TRUMP	I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.	0
618	TRUMP	One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.	0
619	TRUMP	But I have no loans with Russia.	0
620	TRUMP	You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.	0
621	TRUMP	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	0
622	TRUMP	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	0
623	TRUMP	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	0
624	TRUMP	Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.	0
625	TRUMP	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	0
626	TRUMP	Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.	0
627	TRUMP	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	0
628	TRUMP	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	0
629	TRUMP	I'll be very proud to.	0
630	TRUMP	They're actually quite great.	0
631	RADDATZ	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
632	COOPER	We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes.	0
633	COOPER	We have a question from Spencer Maass.	0
634	COOPER	Spencer?	0
635	QUESTION	Good evening.	0
636	QUESTION	My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?	0
637	COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
638	TRUMP	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	0
639	TRUMP	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	0
640	TRUMP	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	0
641	TRUMP	She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.	0
642	TRUMP	She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.	0
643	TRUMP	Well, why didn't she change it?	0
644	TRUMP	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	0
645	TRUMP	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	0
646	TRUMP	And I do.	0
647	TRUMP	You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.	0
648	TRUMP	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	0
649	TRUMP	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.	0
650	TRUMP	You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.	0
651	TRUMP	I wish you would have done this.	0
652	TRUMP	But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.	0
653	TRUMP	She never changed.	0
654	TRUMP	And she never will change.	0
655	TRUMP	She never will change.	0
656	TRUMP	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	0
657	TRUMP	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	0
658	TRUMP	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	0
659	TRUMP	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	0
660	TRUMP	We're cutting taxes for the middle class.	0
661	TRUMP	And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.	0
662	TRUMP	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	1
663	TRUMP	You can look at me.	0
664	TRUMP	She's raising your taxes really high.	1
665	TRUMP	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.	0
666	TRUMP	But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.	1
667	TRUMP	That in itself is a big difference.	0
668	TRUMP	We are going to be thriving again.	0
669	TRUMP	We have no growth in this country.	0
670	TRUMP	There's no growth.	0
671	TRUMP	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
672	TRUMP	We're down at 1 percent.	0
673	TRUMP	And that's, like, no growth.	0
674	TRUMP	And we're going lower, in my opinion.	0
675	TRUMP	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	0
676	TRUMP	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	0
677	TRUMP	And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.	0
678	TRUMP	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	1
679	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0
680	COOPER	The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?	0
681	CLINTON	Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.	0
682	CLINTON	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	0
683	CLINTON	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	0
684	CLINTON	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.	0
685	CLINTON	His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.	0
686	CLINTON	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
687	CLINTON	And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.	1
688	CLINTON	Now, here's what I want to do.	0
689	CLINTON	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	0
690	CLINTON	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	0
691	CLINTON	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	0
692	CLINTON	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	0
693	CLINTON	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
694	CLINTON	It's called the Buffett rule.	0
695	CLINTON	Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.	0
696	CLINTON	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	0
697	CLINTON	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	0
698	CLINTON	I want to invest in hard-working families.	0
699	CLINTON	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	1
700	CLINTON	And we need to reverse that.	0
701	CLINTON	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	0
702	COOPER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
703	CLINTON	And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.	0
704	COOPER	Thank you.	0
705	COOPER	I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.	0
706	COOPER	I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.	0
707	COOPER	In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.	0
708	COOPER	The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.	0
709	COOPER	They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.	0
710	COOPER	You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.	0
711	COOPER	You have not answered, though, a simple question.	0
712	COOPER	Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?	0
713	TRUMP	Of course I do.	0
714	TRUMP	Of course I do.	0
715	TRUMP	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	0
716	TRUMP	I know many of her donors.	0
717	TRUMP	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	0
718	COOPER	So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?	0
719	TRUMP	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	0
720	TRUMP	And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.	0
721	TRUMP	That's why.	0
722	TRUMP	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
723	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.	0
724	TRUMP	But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.	0
725	TRUMP	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.	0
726	TRUMP	But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.	0
727	TRUMP	I absolutely used it.	0
728	TRUMP	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	0
729	TRUMP	Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.	0
730	TRUMP	So we won't make them famous.	0
731	COOPER	So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?	0
732	TRUMP	No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.	0
733	TRUMP	But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.	0
734	TRUMP	I love depreciation.	0
735	TRUMP	You know, she's given it to us.	0
736	TRUMP	Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.	0
737	TRUMP	I say it all the time.	0
738	TRUMP	She talks about health care.	0
739	TRUMP	Why didn't she do something about it?	0
740	TRUMP	She talks about taxes.	0
741	TRUMP	Why didn't she do something about it?	0
742	TRUMP	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	0
743	TRUMP	With her, it's all talk and no action.	0
744	COOPER	In the past...	0
745	TRUMP	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	0
746	TRUMP	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.	0
747	TRUMP	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	0
748	TRUMP	I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.	1
749	TRUMP	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	0
750	TRUMP	Congratulations.	0
751	TRUMP	Great job.	0
752	COOPER	Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.	0
753	CLINTON	Well, here we go again.	0
754	CLINTON	I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.	0
755	CLINTON	But that's not the point here.	0
756	TRUMP	Why didn't you do it?	0
757	TRUMP	Why didn't you do it?	0
758	COOPER	Allow her to respond.	0
759	CLINTON	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	0
760	TRUMP	Oh, really?	0
761	CLINTON	I will be the president and we will get it done.	0
762	CLINTON	That's exactly right.	0
763	TRUMP	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
764	TRUMP	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
765	TRUMP	But you were not an effective senator.	0
766	COOPER	Please allow her to respond.	0
767	COOPER	She didn't interrupt you.	0
768	CLINTON	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	0
769	CLINTON	Look, he has now said repeatedly, "30 years this and 30 years that."	0
770	CLINTON	So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.	0
771	CLINTON	I'm very glad to do so.	0
772	CLINTON	Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.	0
773	CLINTON	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	0
774	CLINTON	After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.	0
775	CLINTON	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	0
776	CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.	0
777	CLINTON	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	0
778	CLINTON	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	0
779	CLINTON	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
780	COOPER	Thank you, secretary.	0
781	CLINTON	I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.	0
782	COOPER	Thank you, secretary.	0
783	RADDATZ	We're going to move on to Syria.	0
784	RADDATZ	Both of you have mentioned that.	0
785	TRUMP	She said a lot of things that were false.	0
786	TRUMP	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	0
787	RADDATZ	No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.	0
788	RADDATZ	This is about the audience.	0
789	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
790	TRUMP	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	0
791	TRUMP	A disaster.	0
792	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.	0
793	RADDATZ	The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.	0
794	RADDATZ	But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.	0
795	RADDATZ	Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.	0
796	RADDATZ	So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.	0
797	RADDATZ	Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?	0
798	RADDATZ	Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?	0
799	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.	0
800	CLINTON	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	0
801	CLINTON	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	0
802	CLINTON	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	0
803	CLINTON	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	0
804	CLINTON	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	0
805	CLINTON	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	0
806	CLINTON	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	0
807	CLINTON	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	0
808	CLINTON	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
809	CLINTON	Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.	0
810	CLINTON	And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.	0
811	CLINTON	I've stood up to Russia.	0
812	CLINTON	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
813	CLINTON	I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.	0
814	CLINTON	And I did as secretary of state.	0
815	CLINTON	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	1
816	CLINTON	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	0
817	CLINTON	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	0
818	CLINTON	But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.	0
819	RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
820	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?	0
821	TRUMP	First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...	0
822	CLINTON	No, I wasn't.	0
823	CLINTON	I was gone.	0
824	CLINTON	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	0
825	TRUMP	OK.	0
826	TRUMP	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
827	TRUMP	You were...	0
828	CLINTON	At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.	0
829	TRUMP	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	0
830	TRUMP	I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.	0
831	TRUMP	Obama draws the line in the sand.	0
832	TRUMP	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
833	TRUMP	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	0
834	TRUMP	But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.	0
835	TRUMP	Not good.	0
836	TRUMP	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
837	TRUMP	Russia is new in terms of nuclear.	0
838	TRUMP	We are old.	0
839	TRUMP	We're tired.	0
840	TRUMP	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.	0
841	TRUMP	A very bad thing.	0
842	TRUMP	Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.	0
843	TRUMP	She talks in favor of the rebels.	0
844	TRUMP	She doesn't even know who the rebels are.	0
845	TRUMP	You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.	0
846	TRUMP	And you know what happens?	0
847	TRUMP	They end up being worse than the people.	0
848	TRUMP	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	0
849	TRUMP	Gadhafi's out.	0
850	TRUMP	It's a mess.	0
851	TRUMP	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.	1
852	TRUMP	I'm sure you probably have heard that.	0
853	TRUMP	It was a disaster.	0
854	TRUMP	Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.	0
855	TRUMP	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	0
856	TRUMP	We sign a peace treaty.	0
857	TRUMP	Everyone's all excited.	0
858	TRUMP	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	0
859	TRUMP	But look at that deal.	0
860	TRUMP	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	0
861	TRUMP	So she wants to fight.	0
862	TRUMP	She wants to fight for rebels.	0
863	TRUMP	There's only one problem.	0
864	TRUMP	You don't even know who the rebels are.	0
865	TRUMP	So what's the purpose?	0
866	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.	0
867	TRUMP	And one thing I have to say.	0
868	RADDATZ	Your two minutes is up.	0
869	TRUMP	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	0
870	TRUMP	Russia is killing ISIS.	0
871	TRUMP	And Iran is killing ISIS.	0
872	TRUMP	And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.	0
873	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.	0
874	RADDATZ	If you were president...	0
875	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
876	RADDATZ	what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?	0
877	RADDATZ	And I want to remind you what your running mate said.	0
878	RADDATZ	He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.	0
879	TRUMP	OK.	0
880	TRUMP	He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.	0
881	TRUMP	I disagree.	0
882	RADDATZ	You disagree with your running mate?	0
883	TRUMP	I think you have to knock out ISIS.	0
884	TRUMP	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	0
885	TRUMP	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	0
886	TRUMP	But Syria is no longer Syria.	0
887	TRUMP	Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.	0
888	TRUMP	I believe we have to get ISIS.	0
889	TRUMP	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	0
890	TRUMP	She had a chance to do something with Syria.	0
891	TRUMP	They had a chance.	0
892	TRUMP	And that was the line.	0
893	TRUMP	And she didn't.	0
894	RADDATZ	What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?	0
895	TRUMP	I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.	0
896	RADDATZ	What do you think will happen if it falls?	0
897	TRUMP	I think that it basically has fallen.	0
898	TRUMP	OK?	0
899	TRUMP	It basically has fallen.	0
900	TRUMP	Let me tell you something.	0
901	TRUMP	You take a look at Mosul.	0
902	TRUMP	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
903	TRUMP	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	0
904	TRUMP	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	0
905	TRUMP	Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.	0
906	TRUMP	Why can't they do it quietly?	0
907	TRUMP	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	0
908	TRUMP	People leave.	0
909	TRUMP	Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?	0
910	TRUMP	How stupid is our country?	0
911	RADDATZ	There are sometimes reasons the military does that.	0
912	RADDATZ	Psychological warfare.	0
913	TRUMP	I can't think of any.	0
914	TRUMP	I can't think of any.	0
915	TRUMP	And I'm pretty good at it.	0
916	RADDATZ	It might be to help get civilians out.	0
917	TRUMP	And we have General Flynn.	0
918	TRUMP	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	0
919	TRUMP	I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.	0
920	TRUMP	We talk about it all the time.	0
921	TRUMP	They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?	0
922	TRUMP	How -- why would these people stay there?	0
923	TRUMP	I've been reading now...	0
924	RADDATZ	Tell me what your strategy is.	0
925	TRUMP	for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	0
926	TRUMP	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.	0
927	TRUMP	They're gone.	0
928	TRUMP	Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.	0
929	TRUMP	Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.	0
930	TRUMP	All I say is this.	0
931	TRUMP	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	0
932	RADDATZ	I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.	0
933	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.	0
934	RADDATZ	You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.	0
935	RADDATZ	You talk about diplomatic efforts.	0
936	RADDATZ	Those have failed.	0
937	RADDATZ	Cease-fires have failed.	0
938	RADDATZ	Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?	0
939	CLINTON	I would not use American ground forces in Syria.	0
940	CLINTON	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	0
941	CLINTON	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	0
942	CLINTON	I don't think that is a smart strategy.	0
943	CLINTON	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	0
944	RADDATZ	But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?	0
945	CLINTON	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	0
946	TRUMP	Everything.	0
947	CLINTON	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
948	CLINTON	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
949	CLINTON	And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.	0
950	CLINTON	No, he doesn't.	0
951	CLINTON	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	0
952	CLINTON	And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.	0
953	CLINTON	I would go after Baghdadi.	0
954	CLINTON	I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.	0
955	CLINTON	So I think that could help.	0
956	CLINTON	I would also consider arming the Kurds.	0
957	CLINTON	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	0
958	CLINTON	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	0
959	RADDATZ	Thank you very much.	0
960	RADDATZ	We're going to move on...	0
961	TRUMP	You know what's funny?	0
962	TRUMP	She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.	0
963	TRUMP	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	0
964	RADDATZ	You had many answers.	0
965	TRUMP	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	0
966	COOPER	We've got a question over here from James Carter.	0
967	COOPER	Mr. Carter?	0
968	QUESTION	My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?	0
969	COOPER	That question begins for Mr. Trump.	0
970	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
971	TRUMP	I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.	0
972	TRUMP	I will be a president for all of our people.	0
973	TRUMP	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.	0
974	TRUMP	Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.	1
975	TRUMP	Not in this country.	0
976	TRUMP	It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.	1
977	TRUMP	We lost our jobs.	0
978	TRUMP	We lost our money.	0
979	TRUMP	We lost our plants.	0
980	TRUMP	It is a disaster.	0
981	TRUMP	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	0
982	TRUMP	She called it the gold standard.	0
983	TRUMP	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	0
984	TRUMP	They actually said that she lied.	0
985	TRUMP	OK?	0
986	TRUMP	And she lied.	0
987	TRUMP	But she's lied about a lot of things.	0
988	TRUMP	I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.	0
989	TRUMP	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	0
990	TRUMP	She's been talking about it for years.	0
991	TRUMP	As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.	0
992	TRUMP	She doesn't get it done.	0
993	TRUMP	Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.	0
994	TRUMP	The same exact thing.	0
995	TRUMP	They talk, they don't get it done.	0
996	TRUMP	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	0
997	TRUMP	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	0
998	TRUMP	The education is a disaster.	0
999	TRUMP	Jobs are essentially nonexistent.	0
1000	TRUMP	I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?	0
1001	TRUMP	It can't get any worse.	0
1002	TRUMP	And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.	0
1003	TRUMP	Nothing's going to ever happen.	0
1004	TRUMP	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	0
1005	TRUMP	It's just going to be talk.	0
1006	TRUMP	And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.	0
1007	TRUMP	She's not doing any me favors.	0
1008	TRUMP	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	0
1009	COOPER	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
1010	TRUMP	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	0
1011	TRUMP	It doesn't get done.	0
1012	TRUMP	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.	0
1013	TRUMP	Take a look at upstate New York.	0
1014	COOPER	Your two minutes is up.	0
1015	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, two minutes?	0
1016	TRUMP	It turned out to be a disaster.	0
1017	COOPER	You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.	0
1018	CLINTON	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	0
1019	CLINTON	Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.	0
1020	CLINTON	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	0
1021	CLINTON	And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.	0
1022	CLINTON	I'm proud of that.	0
1023	CLINTON	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	0
1024	CLINTON	I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.	0
1025	CLINTON	I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.	0
1026	CLINTON	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	0
1027	CLINTON	And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.	0
1028	CLINTON	They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.	0
1029	CLINTON	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.	0
1030	CLINTON	He's 10 years old now.	0
1031	CLINTON	This is the only one country he's ever known.	0
1032	CLINTON	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	0
1033	CLINTON	You know, children listen to what is being said.	0
1034	CLINTON	To go back to the very, very first question.	0
1035	CLINTON	And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.	0
1036	CLINTON	Bullying is up.	0
1037	CLINTON	A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.	0
1038	CLINTON	A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.	0
1039	CLINTON	So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.	0
1040	COOPER	Your time, Secretary Clinton.	0
1041	CLINTON	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	0
1042	CLINTON	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	0
1043	COOPER	Your two minutes is up.	0
1044	CLINTON	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	0
1045	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up.	0
1046	COOPER	I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month.	0
1047	COOPER	You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, "deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic."	0
1048	COOPER	You later said you regretted saying half.	0
1049	COOPER	You didn't express regret for using the term "deplorables."	0
1050	COOPER	To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?	0
1051	CLINTON	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	0
1052	CLINTON	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
1053	CLINTON	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	0
1054	CLINTON	And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.	0
1055	CLINTON	We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.	0
1056	CLINTON	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	0
1057	COOPER	Thank you.	0
1058	CLINTON	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
1059	CLINTON	We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...	0
1060	COOPER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1061	TRUMP	but we believed that we could make the country better.	0
1062	TRUMP	And I was proud of that.	0
1063	COOPER	I want to give you a minute to respond.	0
1064	TRUMP	We have a divided nation.	0
1065	TRUMP	We have a very divided nation.	0
1066	TRUMP	You look at Charlotte.	0
1067	TRUMP	You look at Baltimore.	0
1068	TRUMP	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	0
1069	TRUMP	We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.	0
1070	TRUMP	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	0
1071	TRUMP	And when she said deplorables, she meant it.	0
1072	TRUMP	And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.	0
1073	COOPER	She said some of them are irredeemable.	0
1074	TRUMP	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	0
1075	TRUMP	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	0
1076	COOPER	Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you.	0
1077	COOPER	In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.	0
1078	COOPER	You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, "he or she won't be one for very long."	0
1079	COOPER	In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.	1
1080	COOPER	Is that the discipline of a good leader?	0
1081	TRUMP	No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.	0
1082	TRUMP	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	0
1083	COOPER	You mentioned sex tape.	0
1084	TRUMP	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	0
1085	TRUMP	She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?	0
1086	TRUMP	Guess what?	0
1087	TRUMP	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	0
1088	COOPER	The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?	0
1089	TRUMP	600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	0
1090	TRUMP	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	0
1091	TRUMP	But she said she'll be awake.	0
1092	TRUMP	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
1093	TRUMP	Guess what happened?	0
1094	TRUMP	Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.	1
1095	TRUMP	And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.	0
1096	TRUMP	So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.	0
1097	TRUMP	Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.	0
1098	TRUMP	I mean, you can like it or not like it.	0
1099	TRUMP	I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.	0
1100	TRUMP	It's a very effective way of communication.	0
1101	TRUMP	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	0
1102	TRUMP	I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.	0
1103	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?	0
1104	CLINTON	No.	0
1105	TRUMP	I'm shocked to hear that.	0
1106	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1107	CLINTON	Well, it's not only my opinion.	0
1108	CLINTON	It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.	0
1109	CLINTON	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	0
1110	CLINTON	Everybody.	0
1111	CLINTON	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	0
1112	CLINTON	And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.	0
1113	CLINTON	He stuck with me.	0
1114	CLINTON	And I have worked and I admire President Obama.	0
1115	CLINTON	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	0
1116	CLINTON	That was a terrible time for our country.	0
1117	COOPER	We have to move along.	0
1118	CLINTON	Nine million people lost their jobs.	0
1119	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we have to...	0
1120	CLINTON	Five million homes were lost.	0
1121	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we're moving.	0
1122	CLINTON	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	0
1123	CLINTON	We are back on the right track.	0
1124	CLINTON	He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.	0
1125	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question.	0
1126	RADDATZ	We're almost out of time.	0
1127	RADDATZ	We have another...	0
1128	TRUMP	We have the slowest growth since 1929.	0
1129	RADDATZ	We're moving to an audience question.	0
1130	TRUMP	It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.	0
1131	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience.	0
1132	RADDATZ	Thank you very much both of you.	0
1133	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1134	RADDATZ	We have another audience question.	0
1135	RADDATZ	Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.	0
1136	QUESTION	Good evening.	0
1137	QUESTION	Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.	0
1138	QUESTION	What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?	0
1139	RADDATZ	We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.	0
1140	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
1141	CLINTON	Well, you're right.	0
1142	CLINTON	This is one of the most important issues in this election.	0
1143	CLINTON	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	0
1144	CLINTON	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	0
1145	CLINTON	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
1146	CLINTON	Donald doesn't agree with that.	0
1147	CLINTON	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	0
1148	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	0
1149	CLINTON	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	0
1150	CLINTON	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.	0
1151	CLINTON	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	0
1152	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.	0
1153	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	0
1154	CLINTON	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	0
1155	CLINTON	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	0
1156	CLINTON	I think that was a dereliction of duty.	0
1157	CLINTON	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	0
1158	RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
1159	RADDATZ	Thank you.	0
1160	RADDATZ	You're out of time.	0
1161	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?	0
1162	TRUMP	Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.	0
1163	TRUMP	And we have a vacancy.	0
1164	TRUMP	I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.	0
1165	TRUMP	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	0
1166	TRUMP	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	0
1167	TRUMP	And I think that this is so important.	0
1168	TRUMP	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.	0
1169	TRUMP	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	0
1170	TRUMP	So important to me.	0
1171	TRUMP	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	0
1172	TRUMP	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	0
1173	TRUMP	What I ask is this.	0
1174	TRUMP	So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.	0
1175	TRUMP	Pretty much self-funding money.	0
1176	TRUMP	We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.	0
1177	TRUMP	I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.	0
1178	TRUMP	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	0
1179	TRUMP	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	0
1180	TRUMP	It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.	0
1181	TRUMP	Why aren't you putting some money in?	0
1182	TRUMP	You have a lot of it.	0
1183	TRUMP	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.	0
1184	TRUMP	Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.	0
1185	TRUMP	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?	0
1186	TRUMP	I'm just curious.	0
1187	CLINTON	Well...	0
1188	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1189	RADDATZ	Thank you very much.	0
1190	RADDATZ	We're going to get on to one more question.	0
1191	CLINTON	The question was about the Supreme Court.	0
1192	CLINTON	And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.	0
1193	CLINTON	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	0
1194	COOPER	Thank you.	0
1195	RADDATZ	We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.	0
1196	CLINTON	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	0
1197	COOPER	We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.	0
1198	COOPER	Ken?	0
1199	QUESTION	What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?	0
1200	COOPER	Mr. Trump, two minutes?	0
1201	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
1202	TRUMP	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	0
1203	TRUMP	Under absolutely siege.	0
1204	TRUMP	The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.	0
1205	TRUMP	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.	0
1206	TRUMP	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.	0
1207	TRUMP	Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.	0
1208	TRUMP	But we need much more than wind and solar.	0
1209	TRUMP	And you look at our miners.	0
1210	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	1
1211	TRUMP	There is a thing called clean coal.	0
1212	TRUMP	Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.	0
1213	TRUMP	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.	0
1214	TRUMP	We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.	0
1215	TRUMP	So good.	0
1216	TRUMP	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.	0
1217	TRUMP	I will bring our energy companies back.	0
1218	TRUMP	They'll be able to compete.	0
1219	TRUMP	They'll make money.	0
1220	TRUMP	They'll pay off our national debt.	0
1221	TRUMP	They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.	0
1222	TRUMP	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	0
1223	TRUMP	We have to bring back our workers.	0
1224	TRUMP	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	0
1225	TRUMP	We have to guard our energy companies.	0
1226	TRUMP	We have to make it possible.	0
1227	TRUMP	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	0
1228	TRUMP	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	0
1229	TRUMP	It's a disgrace.	0
1230	COOPER	Your time is up.	0
1231	COOPER	Thank you.	0
1232	TRUMP	It's an absolute disgrace.	0
1233	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, two minutes.	0
1234	CLINTON	And actually -- well, that was very interesting.	0
1235	CLINTON	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	0
1236	CLINTON	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	0
1237	CLINTON	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	1
1238	CLINTON	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	0
1239	CLINTON	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	0
1240	CLINTON	So the price of oil has been way down.	0
1241	CLINTON	And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?	0
1242	CLINTON	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	0
1243	CLINTON	And I think that's an important transition.	0
1244	CLINTON	We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
1245	CLINTON	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.	0
1246	CLINTON	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0
1247	CLINTON	So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.	0
1248	CLINTON	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0
1249	CLINTON	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	0
1250	CLINTON	That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.	0
1251	CLINTON	A lot of them lost their lives.	0
1252	CLINTON	They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.	0
1253	CLINTON	I don't want to walk away from them.	0
1254	CLINTON	So we've got to do something for them.	0
1255	COOPER	Secretary Clinton...	0
1256	CLINTON	But the price of coal is down worldwide.	0
1257	CLINTON	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	0
1258	COOPER	Your time is up.	0
1259	CLINTON	And that's exactly what I have proposed.	0
1260	CLINTON	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
1261	COOPER	Time is up.	0
1262	COOPER	We have time for one more...	0
1263	RADDATZ	We have...	0
1264	COOPER	One more audience question.	0
1265	RADDATZ	We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.	0
1266	QUESTION	Good evening.	0
1267	QUESTION	My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?	0
1268	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1269	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?	0
1270	CLINTON	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
1271	CLINTON	Look, I respect his children.	0
1272	CLINTON	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	0
1273	CLINTON	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	0
1274	CLINTON	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	0
1275	CLINTON	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	0
1276	CLINTON	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
1277	CLINTON	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	0
1278	CLINTON	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	0
1279	CLINTON	And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.	0
1280	CLINTON	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	0
1281	CLINTON	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	0
1282	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?	0
1283	TRUMP	Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.	0
1284	TRUMP	I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.	0
1285	TRUMP	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	0
1286	TRUMP	So I consider that a compliment.	0
1287	TRUMP	I will say this about Hillary.	0
1288	TRUMP	She doesn't quit.	0
1289	TRUMP	She doesn't give up.	0
1290	TRUMP	I respect that.	0
1291	TRUMP	I tell it like it is.	0
1292	TRUMP	She's a fighter.	0
1293	TRUMP	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.	0
1294	TRUMP	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	0
1295	TRUMP	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	0
1296	TRUMP	And I consider that to be a very good trait.	0
1297	RADDATZ	Thanks to both of you.	0
1298	COOPER	We want to thank both the candidates.	0
1299	COOPER	We want to thank the university here.	0
1300	COOPER	This concludes the town hall meeting.	0
1301	COOPER	Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.	0
1302	RADDATZ	Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0
1303	RADDATZ	Good night, everyone.	0
1	QUIJANO	Good evening.	0
2	QUIJANO	From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
3	QUIJANO	I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News.	0
4	QUIJANO	It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.	0
5	QUIJANO	Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.	0
6	QUIJANO	The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.	0
7	QUIJANO	There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.	0
8	QUIJANO	Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.	0
9	QUIJANO	Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.	0
10	QUIJANO	By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.	0
11	QUIJANO	We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.	0
12	QUIJANO	They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.	0
13	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
14	QUIJANO	Gentlemen, welcome.	0
15	QUIJANO	It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.	0
16	QUIJANO	I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.	0
17	QUIJANO	Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.	0
18	QUIJANO	What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?	0
19	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
20	KAINE	Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome.	0
21	KAINE	It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.	0
22	KAINE	This is a very special place.	0
23	KAINE	Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School.	0
24	KAINE	She made history by protesting school segregation.	0
25	KAINE	She believed our nation was stronger together.	0
26	KAINE	And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.	0
27	KAINE	I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.	0
28	KAINE	I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.	0
29	KAINE	That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.	0
30	KAINE	Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.	0
31	KAINE	She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.	0
32	KAINE	It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.	0
33	KAINE	And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.	0
34	KAINE	You've been a city councilman and mayor.	0
35	KAINE	You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.	0
36	KAINE	I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.	0
37	KAINE	And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government.	0
38	KAINE	But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.	0
39	KAINE	And I relish that role.	0
40	KAINE	I'm so proud of her.	0
41	KAINE	I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life.	0
42	KAINE	We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.	0
43	KAINE	We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.	0
44	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
45	PENCE	Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
46	PENCE	It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family.	0
47	PENCE	And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well.	0
48	PENCE	And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.	0
49	PENCE	For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened.	0
50	PENCE	We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.	0
51	PENCE	And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.	0
52	PENCE	I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.	0
53	PENCE	I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville.	0
54	PENCE	I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.	0
55	PENCE	My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.	0
56	PENCE	My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.	0
57	PENCE	They built a family and -- and a good name and a business.	0
58	PENCE	And they raised a family.	0
59	PENCE	And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.	0
60	PENCE	So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States.	0
61	PENCE	And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.	0
62	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy.	0
63	QUIJANO	Why do so many people distrust her?	0
64	QUIJANO	Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?	0
65	KAINE	Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.	0
66	KAINE	Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.	0
67	KAINE	Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?	0
68	KAINE	And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?	0
69	KAINE	Hillary Clinton has that passion.	0
70	KAINE	From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids.	0
71	KAINE	As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.	0
72	KAINE	And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.	0
73	KAINE	Donald Trump always puts himself first.	0
74	KAINE	He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, "off the backs of the little guy."	0
75	KAINE	And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.	0
76	KAINE	It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.	0
77	KAINE	And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish "me first" style of Donald Trump.	0
78	QUIJANO	Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, "thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."	0
79	QUIJANO	Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president.	0
80	QUIJANO	Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?	0
81	PENCE	Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign.	0
82	PENCE	It really is remarkable.	0
83	PENCE	At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.	0
84	PENCE	I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.	0
85	PENCE	The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...	0
86	KAINE	You guys love Russia.	0
87	KAINE	You both have said...	0
88	PENCE	their heavy-handed approach.	0
89	KAINE	You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.	0
90	PENCE	Well...	0
91	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
92	QUIJANO	Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment.	0
93	QUIJANO	But I do want to get back to the question at...	0
94	PENCE	But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you.	0
95	PENCE	Thank you.	0
96	PENCE	Thank you, Senator, I'll...	0
97	KAINE	These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.	0
98	KAINE	How can that...	0
99	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
100	QUIJANO	Yes, and we will get to that, Senator.	0
101	QUIJANO	We do have that coming up here.	0
102	QUIJANO	But in the meantime, the questions...	0
103	PENCE	Well, Senator, I must have hit a...	0
104	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
105	PENCE	I must have hit a nerve here.	0
106	QUIJANO	Why the disconnect?	0
107	PENCE	Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.	0
108	PENCE	Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times.	0
109	PENCE	He's brought an extraordinary business acumen.	0
110	PENCE	He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.	0
111	KAINE	And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.	0
112	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
113	QUIJANO	And why the disconnect with your running mate?	0
114	PENCE	But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.	0
115	PENCE	And that's because they're paying attention.	0
116	PENCE	I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on.	0
117	PENCE	She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.	0
118	KAINE	You are Donald Trump's apprentice.	0
119	KAINE	Let me talk about this...	0
120	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
121	PENCE	Senator, I think I'm still on my time.	0
122	KAINE	Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?	0
123	QUIJANO	This is our open discussion.	0
124	KAINE	Yeah, let's talk about the state of...	0
125	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
126	PENCE	Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.	0
127	KAINE	Finish your sentence.	0
128	PENCE	The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.	0
129	KAINE	OK, now I can weigh in.	0
130	KAINE	Now...	0
131	PENCE	She had a private server...	0
132	KAINE	Now, I get to weigh in.	0
133	KAINE	Now, let me just say this...	0
134	PENCE	that was discovered...	0
135	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
136	QUIJANO	Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.	0
137	PENCE	keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.	0
138	KAINE	Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.	0
139	PENCE	Do you?	0
140	KAINE	Let me tell you this.	0
141	KAINE	When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?	0
142	PENCE	Yes.	0
143	KAINE	Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?	0
144	KAINE	Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?	0
145	KAINE	Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth.	0
146	KAINE	She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.	1
147	KAINE	She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.	1
148	PENCE	Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?	0
149	KAINE	Absolutely, without firing a shot.	0
150	KAINE	And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.	0
151	PENCE	Right and...	0
152	KAINE	These are very, very good things.	0
153	PENCE	And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...	0
154	KAINE	Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.	0
155	PENCE	Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...	0
156	KAINE	No, that is incorrect.	0
157	KAINE	That's incorrect.	0
158	PENCE	And so we removed -- we removed all of our...	0
159	QUIJANO	Gentlemen, we'll get to...	0
160	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
161	PENCE	troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.	0
162	KAINE	But I'd like to correct...	0
163	PENCE	and overrun vast areas of Iraq.	0
164	KAINE	Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.	1
165	KAINE	And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.	1
166	KAINE	And guess what?	0
167	KAINE	If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.	0
168	PENCE	It was a failure of the secretary of state...	0
169	QUIJANO	We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.	0
170	KAINE	If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...	0
171	QUIJANO	There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.	0
172	QUIJANO	Let's turn to the issue of the economy.	0
173	KAINE	OK.	0
174	QUIJANO	According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.	0
175	QUIJANO	In fact, your plans would add even more to it.	0
176	QUIJANO	Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.	0
177	QUIJANO	Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.	0
178	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
179	PENCE	I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.	0
180	PENCE	I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.	0
181	PENCE	The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.	1
182	PENCE	We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.	1
183	PENCE	That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.	0
184	PENCE	He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.	0
185	PENCE	He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.	0
186	PENCE	In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.	1
187	PENCE	But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.	0
188	PENCE	It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.	0
189	PENCE	You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.	0
190	PENCE	But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.	0
191	PENCE	But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.	0
192	PENCE	They want to expand it into a single-payer program.	0
193	PENCE	And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.	0
194	PENCE	Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.	0
195	PENCE	We can get America moving again.	0
196	PENCE	Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.	0
197	PENCE	And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.	0
198	PENCE	When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.	0
199	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
200	KAINE	Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.	0
201	KAINE	Do you want a "you're hired" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a "you're fired" president in Donald Trump?	0
202	KAINE	I think that's not such a hard choice.	0
203	KAINE	Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a "you're hired" plan.	0
204	KAINE	Five components.	0
205	KAINE	First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.	0
206	KAINE	Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.	0
207	KAINE	Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.	0
208	KAINE	Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.	0
209	KAINE	Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.	0
210	KAINE	My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.	0
211	KAINE	And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.	0
212	KAINE	The Trump plan is a different plan.	0
213	KAINE	It's a "you're fired" plan.	0
214	KAINE	And there's two key elements to it.	0
215	KAINE	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.	1
216	KAINE	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.	0
217	KAINE	Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.	0
218	KAINE	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.	0
219	KAINE	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.	0
220	KAINE	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.	0
221	KAINE	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.	1
222	KAINE	The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.	1
223	KAINE	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?	0
224	KAINE	Because his tax plan basically helps him.	0
225	KAINE	And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.	0
226	QUIJANO	On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.	0
227	QUIJANO	Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.	0
228	QUIJANO	Does that seem fair to you?	0
229	PENCE	Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the "you're hired," "you're fired" thing, Senator.	0
230	PENCE	You use that a whole lot.	0
231	PENCE	And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.	0
232	PENCE	Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.	0
233	PENCE	And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table.	0
234	PENCE	I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.	0
235	PENCE	We're in the...	0
236	KAINE	Fifteen million new jobs?	1
237	PENCE	slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.	0
238	KAINE	Fifteen million new jobs?	1
239	QUIJANO	Governor...	0
240	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
241	PENCE	There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...	0
242	KAINE	And the poverty level and the median income...	0
243	PENCE	stepped into the Oval Office.	0
244	KAINE	improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.	0
245	PENCE	You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different.	0
246	PENCE	People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different.	0
247	PENCE	I mean, this economy is struggling.	0
248	PENCE	The answer to this economy is not more taxes.	0
249	KAINE	But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.	0
250	PENCE	It's not more spending...	0
251	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
252	KAINE	I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.	0
253	PENCE	Absolutely I will.	0
254	QUIJANO	Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.	0
255	PENCE	Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine.	0
256	PENCE	And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician.	0
257	PENCE	He actually built a business.	0
258	PENCE	Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.	0
259	PENCE	But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss.	0
260	PENCE	We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.	0
261	KAINE	But why won't he release his tax returns?	0
262	PENCE	Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...	0
263	KAINE	I do want to come back to that, but...	0
264	PENCE	His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used.	0
265	PENCE	And he did it brilliantly.	0
266	KAINE	How do you know that?	0
267	KAINE	You haven't seen his tax returns.	0
268	PENCE	He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.	0
269	KAINE	How do you know that?	0
270	PENCE	And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.	0
271	PENCE	And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...	0
272	KAINE	Elaine, let me talk about something.	0
273	QUIJANO	Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.	0
274	KAINE	OK.	0
275	PENCE	The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.	0
276	KAINE	Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, "If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."	0
277	KAINE	He's broken his first...	0
278	PENCE	And he will.	0
279	KAINE	He's broken his first promise.	0
280	KAINE	Second, he stood on the stage...	0
281	PENCE	He hasn't broken his promise.	0
282	PENCE	He said he's...	0
283	KAINE	He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, "That makes me smart."	0
284	KAINE	So it's smart not to pay for our military?	0
285	KAINE	It's smart not to pay for veterans?	0
286	KAINE	It's smart not to pay for teachers?	0
287	KAINE	And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid.	0
288	KAINE	And the last thing I'll say is this...	0
289	PENCE	Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?	0
290	KAINE	The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...	0
291	PENCE	I do.	0
292	KAINE	Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.	0
293	KAINE	Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president.	0
294	KAINE	And he's breaking his promise.	0
295	PENCE	Elaine, I have to respond to this.	0
296	QUIJANO	You get very little time, 20 seconds.	0
297	PENCE	I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.	0
298	QUIJANO	Governor?	0
299	PENCE	Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.	0
300	KAINE	But he said he would release his tax returns.	0
301	QUIJANO	All right, Gentlemen...	0
302	PENCE	The American people can review that.	0
303	PENCE	And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...	0
304	QUIJANO	I need to ask you about Social Security...	0
305	KAINE	Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.	1
306	PENCE	They're going to raise your taxes.	0
307	PENCE	We're going to cut your taxes.	0
308	QUIJANO	Gentlemen...	0
309	KAINE	If you can't meet Nixon's standard...	0
310	QUIJANO	The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other.	0
311	QUIJANO	I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.	0
312	KAINE	All right.	0
313	KAINE	We're having fun up here.	0
314	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76.	0
315	QUIJANO	The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year.	0
316	QUIJANO	What would your administration do to prevent this cut?	0
317	KAINE	First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done.	0
318	KAINE	It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty.	0
319	KAINE	And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.	0
320	KAINE	We have to keep it solvent.	0
321	KAINE	And we will keep it solvent.	0
322	KAINE	And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.	0
323	KAINE	Here's what Hillary and I will not do.	0
324	KAINE	And I want to make this very plain.	0
325	KAINE	We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.	0
326	KAINE	Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.	0
327	KAINE	And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.	0
328	KAINE	Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it.	0
329	KAINE	We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security.	0
330	KAINE	And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.	0
331	QUIJANO	Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond.	0
332	PENCE	Well, thanks, Elaine.	0
333	PENCE	There they go again.	0
334	PENCE	OK...	0
335	KAINE	Go read -- go read the book.	0
336	PENCE	All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors.	0
337	PENCE	That's it.	0
338	KAINE	Go read the book.	0
339	PENCE	We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare.	0
340	PENCE	That's what this campaign is really about, Senator.	0
341	PENCE	And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out...	0
342	KAINE	But -- but you have a voting record, Governor.	0
343	PENCE	And I get all of that.	0
344	PENCE	I just, look...	0
345	KAINE	I...	0
346	PENCE	There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.	0
347	KAINE	I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.	0
348	PENCE	I have to go back to.	0
349	QUIJANO	We...	0
350	PENCE	Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security.	0
351	PENCE	Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes.	0
352	PENCE	We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to...	0
353	KAINE	You're not going to cut taxes.	1
354	KAINE	You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.	1
355	PENCE	reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.	0
356	QUIJANO	All right.	0
357	PENCE	Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt.	0
358	PENCE	And we're going to face hard choices and...	0
359	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
360	QUIJANO	Gentleman, I want to move on now.	0
361	KAINE	You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.	0
362	QUIJANO	All right.	0
363	QUIJANO	Let me move on now...	0
364	PENCE	Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy.	0
365	QUIJANO	to the issue of law enforcement and race relations.	0
366	QUIJANO	Law enforcement and race relations.	0
367	QUIJANO	After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, "We're asking cops to do too much in this country.	0
368	QUIJANO	Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve.	0
369	QUIJANO	Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."	0
370	QUIJANO	Do we ask too much of police officers in this country?	0
371	QUIJANO	And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns?	0
372	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
373	KAINE	Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment.	0
374	KAINE	I think we put a lot on police shoulders.	0
375	KAINE	And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.	0
376	KAINE	I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.	0
377	KAINE	And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.	0
378	KAINE	We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.	0
379	KAINE	And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too.	0
380	KAINE	And we did something we had really wanted to do.	0
381	KAINE	For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.	0
382	KAINE	Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.	0
383	KAINE	The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.	0
384	KAINE	You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.	0
385	KAINE	And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.	0
386	KAINE	That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.	0
387	KAINE	Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.	0
388	KAINE	That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.	0
389	KAINE	So here's what we'll do.	0
390	KAINE	We'll focus on community policing.	0
391	KAINE	We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.	0
392	KAINE	I'm a gun-owner.	0
393	KAINE	I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.	0
394	KAINE	But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.	0
395	KAINE	And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.	0
396	KAINE	One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu.	0
397	KAINE	He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor.	0
398	KAINE	He had survived the Holocaust.	0
399	KAINE	Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.	0
400	KAINE	But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence.	0
401	KAINE	We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.	0
402	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
403	PENCE	You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago.	0
404	PENCE	He was my hero when I was growing up.	0
405	PENCE	And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago.	0
406	PENCE	My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side.	0
407	PENCE	Police officers are the best of us.	0
408	PENCE	And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day.	0
409	PENCE	And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea.	0
410	PENCE	It's worked in the Hoosier state.	0
411	PENCE	And we fully support that.	0
412	PENCE	Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.	0
413	PENCE	It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.	0
414	PENCE	They see his commitment to law and order.	0
415	PENCE	But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.	0
416	PENCE	And that really has got to stop.	0
417	PENCE	I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.	0
418	PENCE	I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn.	0
419	PENCE	We -- we grieve with those who grieve.	0
420	PENCE	And we're saddened at the loss of life.	0
421	PENCE	But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.	1
422	PENCE	I just think...	0
423	KAINE	Can I -- can I explain...	0
424	PENCE	I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.	0
425	PENCE	We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.	0
426	PENCE	But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.	0
427	KAINE	Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement.	0
428	KAINE	And if you're afraid to have...	0
429	PENCE	I'm not afraid to bring that up.	0
430	KAINE	And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it.	0
431	KAINE	And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking.	0
432	KAINE	We would agree this was a heartbreaking example.	0
433	KAINE	The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school.	0
434	KAINE	And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.	0
435	KAINE	But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked.	0
436	KAINE	The kids loved him.	0
437	KAINE	But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.	0
438	KAINE	And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.	0
439	PENCE	We need criminal justice reform.	0
440	KAINE	Well, we do.	0
441	PENCE	Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.	0
442	KAINE	But I just want to say, those who say that we should not...	0
443	PENCE	But that's not what you're talking about.	0
444	KAINE	we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem...	0
445	QUIJANO	Governor Pence...	0
446	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
447	QUIJANO	Governor Pence...	0
448	PENCE	Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?	1
449	KAINE	Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even...	0
450	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
451	QUIJANO	Governor Pence, I have a question on that point.	0
452	PENCE	I did not make that statement.	0
453	PENCE	I...	0
454	QUIJANO	Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor.	0
455	QUIJANO	He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.	0
456	KAINE	A U.S. senator.	0
457	QUIJANO	He said, "I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."	0
458	QUIJANO	What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?	0
459	PENCE	Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend.	0
460	PENCE	And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally.	0
461	PENCE	I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it.	0
462	PENCE	I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act.	0
463	PENCE	We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice.	0
464	PENCE	But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement.	0
465	PENCE	We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...	0
466	KAINE	Elaine, can I...	0
467	QUIJANO	So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?	0
468	PENCE	Law enforcement in this country is a force for good.	0
469	PENCE	They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day.	0
470	PENCE	But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement.	0
471	PENCE	You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk.	0
472	PENCE	Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime...	0
473	KAINE	Elaine, let me -- let me...	0
474	QUIJANO	Governor, the question is about Senator Scott.	0
475	QUIJANO	What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott?	0
476	KAINE	Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in.	0
477	KAINE	I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea.	0
478	KAINE	And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law.	0
479	KAINE	So there is a fundamental respect issue here.	0
480	KAINE	And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top.	0
481	KAINE	Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.	0
482	KAINE	He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.	0
483	KAINE	I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother.	0
484	KAINE	He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican.	0
485	KAINE	He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured.	0
486	KAINE	He said African-Americans are living in Hell.	0
487	KAINE	And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.	0
488	KAINE	If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about.	0
489	KAINE	And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.	0
490	QUIJANO	All right.	0
491	QUIJANO	I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration.	0
492	QUIJANO	Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported.	0
493	QUIJANO	What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes?	0
494	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
495	PENCE	Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.	0
496	PENCE	We've been talking it to death for 20 years.	0
497	PENCE	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.	0
498	PENCE	But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement.	0
499	PENCE	It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.	0
500	PENCE	And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas.	0
501	PENCE	And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.	0
502	PENCE	But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.	0
503	KAINE	These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor.	0
504	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
505	PENCE	It's my time, Senator.	0
506	QUIJANO	It is, in fact, the governor's time.	0
507	KAINE	I apologize.	0
508	KAINE	It's your two minutes.	0
509	KAINE	I apologize.	0
510	PENCE	Thanks.	0
511	PENCE	I forgive you.	0
512	PENCE	He says ours is an insult-driven campaign.	0
513	PENCE	Did you all just hear that?	0
514	PENCE	Ours is an insult-driven campaign?	0
515	PENCE	I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.	0
516	PENCE	It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.	0
517	PENCE	I mean, it's extraordinary.	0
518	PENCE	And then she labeled one after another "ism" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all.	0
519	PENCE	So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean...	0
520	QUIJANO	Governor...	0
521	PENCE	That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...	0
522	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
523	PENCE	calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.	0
524	KAINE	Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that.	0
525	PENCE	She said she shouldn't have said half.	0
526	QUIJANO	Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.	0
527	KAINE	Yeah, that's right, so now we're even.	0
528	PENCE	Yeah.	0
529	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
530	KAINE	Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...	0
531	PENCE	Oh...	0
532	KAINE	to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.	0
533	PENCE	She apologized for saying "half."	0
534	QUIJANO	Governor.	0
535	QUIJANO	It is his two minutes, please.	0
536	KAINE	Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?	0
537	KAINE	Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell?	0
538	KAINE	Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?	0
539	KAINE	You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.	0
540	KAINE	Immigration.	0
541	KAINE	There's two plans on the table.	0
542	KAINE	Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform.	0
543	KAINE	Donald Trump believes in deportation nation.	0
544	KAINE	You've got to pick your choice.	0
545	KAINE	Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.	0
546	KAINE	That's our proposal.	0
547	KAINE	Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents.	0
548	KAINE	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.	0
549	KAINE	So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that.	0
550	KAINE	That's another 4.5 million people.	0
551	KAINE	These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force.	0
552	KAINE	They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.	0
553	KAINE	And I cannot believe...	0
554	PENCE	That's nonsense.	0
555	PENCE	That's nonsense.	0
556	KAINE	I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.	0
557	PENCE	Senator, we have a deportation force.	0
558	PENCE	It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.	0
559	PENCE	And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.	0
560	KAINE	So you like the 16 million deportations?	0
561	PENCE	Senator, that's -- that's nonsense.	0
562	PENCE	Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.	1
563	PENCE	That's...	0
564	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
565	KAINE	Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.	0
566	PENCE	They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill.	0
567	PENCE	We all know the routine.	0
568	PENCE	It's amnesty.	0
569	PENCE	And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.	0
570	PENCE	That's how Washington always plays it.	0
571	KAINE	No, I...	0
572	PENCE	They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border...	0
573	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
574	KAINE	border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.	0
575	QUIJANO	Governor, Mr. Trump has said...	0
576	PENCE	Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.	0
577	PENCE	Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.	0
578	QUIJANO	So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave?	0
579	QUIJANO	Would they be forcibly removed?	0
580	PENCE	Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security.	0
581	PENCE	It begins with border security.	0
582	PENCE	And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.	0
583	PENCE	But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens.	0
584	PENCE	We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement.	0
585	PENCE	We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities.	0
586	PENCE	The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity.	0
587	PENCE	And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.	0
588	PENCE	Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas.	0
589	PENCE	We're going to enforce the law of this country.	0
590	PENCE	We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that.	0
591	PENCE	And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...	0
592	KAINE	I just have to correct Governor Pence....	0
593	PENCE	where people can come into this country.	0
594	KAINE	I have to...	0
595	PENCE	That's the order that you should do it.	0
596	PENCE	Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.	0
597	KAINE	I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in.	0
598	KAINE	But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said.	0
599	KAINE	When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.	0
600	KAINE	He said, quote, "They will all be gone."	0
601	KAINE	They will all be gone.	0
602	KAINE	And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said.	0
603	KAINE	And to add...	0
604	PENCE	He's talking about criminal aliens.	0
605	KAINE	And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants.	0
606	KAINE	Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families.	0
607	KAINE	Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger.	0
608	KAINE	When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.	0
609	QUIJANO	Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism.	0
610	QUIJANO	Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?	0
611	QUIJANO	Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?	0
612	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
613	KAINE	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead.	0
614	KAINE	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped.	0
615	KAINE	The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world.	0
616	KAINE	There's only 15,000.	0
617	KAINE	But there are other parts of the world that are challenging.	0
618	KAINE	Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton.	0
619	KAINE	Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11.	0
620	KAINE	She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors.	0
621	KAINE	That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.	0
622	KAINE	And she's got a plan to do it.	0
623	KAINE	She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden.	0
624	KAINE	Here's her plan to defeat ISIL.	0
625	KAINE	First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield.	0
626	KAINE	She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.	0
627	KAINE	Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens.	0
628	KAINE	But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence.	0
629	KAINE	That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.	0
630	KAINE	Donald Trump.	0
631	KAINE	Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot.	0
632	KAINE	Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.	0
633	KAINE	He said, I have a secret plan," and then he said, Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.	0
634	KAINE	And then he said, "I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."	0
635	KAINE	And finally he said, "I'm going to fire all the generals."	0
636	KAINE	He doesn't have a plan.	0
637	KAINE	But he does have dangerous ideas.	0
638	KAINE	Here's four.	0
639	KAINE	He trash talks the military.	0
640	KAINE	The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.	0
641	KAINE	He wants to tear up alliances.	0
642	KAINE	NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay "big league."	0
643	KAINE	Third, he loves dictators.	0
644	KAINE	He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...	0
645	PENCE	Oh, please.	0
646	PENCE	Come on.	0
647	KAINE	and Saddam Hussein.	0
648	KAINE	And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.	1
649	KAINE	He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them.	1
650	KAINE	And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: "Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."	1
651	KAINE	I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.	0
652	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
653	PENCE	Did you work on that one a long time?	0
654	PENCE	Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.	0
655	KAINE	Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it.	0
656	PENCE	Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States.	0
657	PENCE	It's absolutely inarguable.	0
658	PENCE	We've weakened America's place in the world.	0
659	PENCE	It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership.	0
660	PENCE	I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11.	0
661	PENCE	I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.	0
662	KAINE	I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...	0
663	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
664	PENCE	I know you were.	0
665	PENCE	We all lived through that day as a nation.	0
666	PENCE	It was heartbreaking.	0
667	PENCE	And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.	0
668	PENCE	But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida.	0
669	PENCE	Our primary threat today is ISIS.	0
670	PENCE	And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0
671	PENCE	My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl.	0
672	PENCE	Scott Zubowski.	0
673	PENCE	He fell in Fallujah in 2005.	0
674	PENCE	He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation.	0
675	PENCE	And that nation was secured in 2009.	0
676	PENCE	But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war.	0
677	PENCE	The president just ordered more troops on the ground.	0
678	PENCE	We are back at war in Iraq.	0
679	PENCE	And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.	0
680	PENCE	And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.	0
681	KAINE	Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?	0
682	PENCE	You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.	0
683	KAINE	Yes, we did.	0
684	PENCE	You essentially...	0
685	KAINE	Even the Israeli military says it stopped.	0
686	PENCE	guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.	0
687	QUIJANO	Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism.	0
688	QUIJANO	But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey.	0
689	QUIJANO	Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents.	0
690	QUIJANO	What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?	0
691	PENCE	Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.	0
692	PENCE	I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.	0
693	PENCE	But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.	0
694	PENCE	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...	0
695	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
696	KAINE	Elaine, I want to...	0
697	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
698	QUIJANO	Governor, the question was about homegrown.	0
699	PENCE	Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program...	0
700	KAINE	Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.	0
701	PENCE	That's not -- that's absolutely false.	0
702	KAINE	That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine.	0
703	PENCE	The Seventh Circuit...	0
704	KAINE	We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration.	0
705	KAINE	Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous?	0
706	KAINE	These guys say all Mexicans are bad.	0
707	PENCE	That's absolutely false.	0
708	KAINE	And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous.	0
709	KAINE	Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim.	0
710	KAINE	Mike Pence...	0
711	PENCE	Absolutely...	0
712	KAINE	put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria.	0
713	KAINE	And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...	0
714	PENCE	Right.	0
715	PENCE	Right.	0
716	KAINE	and said it was discriminatory...	0
717	PENCE	And those judges -- those judges said...	0
718	KAINE	We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.	0
719	QUIJANO	Governor?	0
720	PENCE	Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States.	0
721	PENCE	Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.	0
722	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
723	KAINE	But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.	0
724	PENCE	But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game.	0
725	PENCE	I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.	0
726	KAINE	But, Governor Pence...	0
727	PENCE	So you bet I suspended that program.	0
728	KAINE	But, Governor Pence, I just...	0
729	PENCE	And I stand by that decision.	0
730	PENCE	And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.	0
731	KAINE	Sure.	0
732	KAINE	Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not.	0
733	KAINE	We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.	0
734	PENCE	But the problem with that...	0
735	KAINE	That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...	0
736	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
737	PENCE	Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.	0
738	KAINE	Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in.	0
739	PENCE	So -- the FBI...	0
740	KAINE	When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.	0
741	PENCE	The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain.	0
742	PENCE	You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator.	0
743	PENCE	I understand the...	0
744	KAINE	By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?	0
745	PENCE	the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...	0
746	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, let me ask you this.	0
747	QUIJANO	Secretary Clinton...	0
748	PENCE	We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.	0
749	QUIJANO	has talked about an intelligence surge.	0
750	KAINE	Yes.	0
751	QUIJANO	What exactly would an intelligence surge look like?	0
752	QUIJANO	And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?	0
753	KAINE	Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine.	0
754	KAINE	It's two things.	0
755	KAINE	It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.	0
756	KAINE	So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.	0
757	KAINE	But the second piece of this is really, really important.	0
758	KAINE	It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies.	0
759	KAINE	And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next.	0
760	KAINE	Alliances are critical.	0
761	KAINE	That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.	1
762	PENCE	That's not his plan.	0
763	KAINE	Well, he said NATO is obsolete.	0
764	KAINE	And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?	0
765	KAINE	Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances.	0
766	KAINE	She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.	0
767	KAINE	And that's what an intelligence surge means.	0
768	KAINE	Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.	0
769	QUIJANO	All right.	0
770	QUIJANO	I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria.	0
771	QUIJANO	Two hundred fifty thousand...	0
772	PENCE	Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?	0
773	QUIJANO	You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.	0
774	PENCE	First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week.	0
775	PENCE	We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country.	0
776	PENCE	And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.	0
777	KAINE	We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.	0
778	PENCE	We have an intelligence, sir (ph).	0
779	PENCE	But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...	0
780	QUIJANO	And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up.	0
781	PENCE	about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.	0
782	QUIJANO	Right.	0
783	PENCE	Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...	0
784	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
785	QUIJANO	I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor.	0
786	PENCE	We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server.	0
787	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
788	KAINE	And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step.	1
789	KAINE	You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this.	0
790	KAINE	We have a justice system that does that.	0
791	KAINE	And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that...	1
792	QUIJANO	All right, we are moving on now.	0
793	QUIJANO	Two hundred fifty thousand people...	0
794	PENCE	If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...	0
795	QUIJANO	one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor...	0
796	PENCE	they'd be court martialed.	0
797	KAINE	That is absolutely false and you know that.	0
798	PENCE	Absolutely true.	0
799	KAINE	And you know that, Governor.	0
800	QUIJANO	Governor...	0
801	PENCE	It's absolutely true.	0
802	QUIJANO	Gentlemen, please.	0
803	KAINE	Because the FBI did an investigation.	0
804	QUIJANO	Gentlemen.	0
805	KAINE	And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further.	0
806	KAINE	Sorry.	0
807	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.	0
808	KAINE	Syria.	0
809	QUIJANO	I want to turn now to Syria.	0
810	QUIJANO	Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria.	0
811	QUIJANO	Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries.	0
812	QUIJANO	Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?	0
813	PENCE	The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo.	0
814	PENCE	Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset.	0
815	PENCE	After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.	0
816	PENCE	And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.	0
817	PENCE	It begins by rebuilding our military.	0
818	PENCE	And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military.	0
819	PENCE	We have the smallest Navy since 1916.	0
820	PENCE	We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War.	0
821	PENCE	We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.	0
822	PENCE	But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.	0
823	PENCE	And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.	0
824	PENCE	And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.	0
825	PENCE	There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.	0
826	PENCE	We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.	0
827	QUIJANO	Governor, your two minutes are up.	0
828	PENCE	We've just got to have American strength on the world stage.	0
829	PENCE	When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president.	0
830	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
831	KAINE	Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea.	0
832	KAINE	And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not.	0
833	KAINE	Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin.	0
834	KAINE	And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.	0
835	KAINE	The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces.	0
836	KAINE	Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.	0
837	KAINE	Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.	0
838	KAINE	He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists.	0
839	KAINE	If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.	0
840	KAINE	I'll tell you what offends me...	0
841	PENCE	Well, that offended me.	0
842	KAINE	Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military.	0
843	KAINE	No, he won't.	0
844	KAINE	Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes.	0
845	KAINE	The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995.	0
846	KAINE	Those years included the years of 9/11.	0
847	KAINE	So get this.	0
848	KAINE	On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States.	0
849	KAINE	Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism.	0
850	KAINE	Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight.	0
851	KAINE	It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.	0
852	QUIJANO	The question was about Aleppo, Senator.	0
853	KAINE	He wouldn't support troops.	0
854	KAINE	He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine.	0
855	KAINE	When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.	0
856	QUIJANO	Right.	0
857	KAINE	And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria.	0
858	KAINE	It's very important.	0
859	QUIJANO	Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone.	0
860	QUIJANO	Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically?	0
861	QUIJANO	How would you keep it safe?	0
862	PENCE	Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops.	0
863	PENCE	Donald Trump supports our veterans.	0
864	KAINE	He won't pay taxes.	0
865	PENCE	Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?	0
866	PENCE	How does that work?	0
867	QUIJANO	Gentlemen, this is about Syria.	0
868	QUIJANO	I'd like to...	0
869	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
870	PENCE	Honestly, Senator.	0
871	PENCE	Honestly, Senator.	0
872	KAINE	It is about our troops.	0
873	KAINE	It is about our troops.	0
874	PENCE	I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.	0
875	KAINE	How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?	0
876	PENCE	I understand why you want to change the subject.	0
877	PENCE	And let me be very clear on this Russian thing.	0
878	PENCE	The larger question here...	0
879	KAINE	Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?	0
880	QUIJANO	Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.	0
881	PENCE	What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates.	0
882	PENCE	And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.	0
883	PENCE	And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore.	0
884	PENCE	To answer your question, we just need American strength.	0
885	PENCE	We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way.	0
886	QUIJANO	And exactly how would those safe zones work?	0
887	QUIJANO	How would they remain safe?	0
888	PENCE	The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community.	0
889	PENCE	The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.	0
890	PENCE	But, look, this is very tough stuff.	0
891	PENCE	I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade.	0
892	PENCE	I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years.	0
893	PENCE	I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0
894	PENCE	And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...	0
895	KAINE	Well, let me -- let me come back...	0
896	PENCE	is deeply troubling to me.	0
897	PENCE	That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.	0
898	KAINE	and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine.	0
899	KAINE	He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.	0
900	KAINE	He doesn't want to acknowledge...	0
901	PENCE	We didn't.	0
902	KAINE	that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden.	0
903	KAINE	He doesn't want to acknowledge...	0
904	PENCE	I just did.	0
905	KAINE	that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.	0
906	KAINE	But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous.	0
907	KAINE	Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.	0
908	KAINE	Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.	0
909	KAINE	He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.	0
910	KAINE	And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.	0
911	PENCE	And come on.	0
912	PENCE	Senator.	0
913	PENCE	Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton.	0
914	PENCE	And that -- that's pretty low.	0
915	KAINE	But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?	0
916	PENCE	Senator, the...	0
917	KAINE	That's what Donald Trump thinks.	0
918	PENCE	Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.	0
919	PENCE	And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...	0
920	KAINE	But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?	0
921	PENCE	and assurance to our allies.	0
922	PENCE	But let me go back to this Iran thing.	0
923	PENCE	I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.	0
924	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
925	KAINE	That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.	0
926	PENCE	Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks.	0
927	KAINE	Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.	0
928	PENCE	You wouldn't necessarily know that.	0
929	KAINE	Go to the tape.	0
930	PENCE	I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.	0
931	KAINE	No, I visited him in his office.	0
932	KAINE	I visited him in his office.	0
933	PENCE	You boycotted the speech.	0
934	PENCE	The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.	0
935	KAINE	And then Hillary used them to get a deal.	0
936	PENCE	We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.	0
937	KAINE	Elaine, let me just mention one thing.	0
938	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
939	PENCE	They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence.	0
940	PENCE	They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions.	0
941	PENCE	And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons.	0
942	PENCE	That...	0
943	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
944	QUIJANO	And very quickly, Senator.	0
945	KAINE	Elaine...	0
946	PENCE	and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...	0
947	QUIJANO	We need to talk about Russia.	0
948	QUIJANO	Very quickly, though, Senator, please.	0
949	PENCE	is astonishing to the American people.	0
950	KAINE	Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next.	0
951	KAINE	And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.	0
952	PENCE	Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth.	0
953	QUIJANO	All right.	0
954	PENCE	He's going...	0
955	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
956	KAINE	And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.	0
957	KAINE	And I just think that should be underlined.	0
958	PENCE	No, I'm -- look...	0
959	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
960	QUIJANO	All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia.	0
961	QUIJANO	This is a topic that has come up.	0
962	PENCE	I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump.	0
963	PENCE	If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.	0
964	QUIJANO	I will give you an opportunity to do that.	0
965	KAINE	More nations should get nuclear weapons.	0
966	KAINE	Try to defend that.	0
967	PENCE	Don't put words in my mouth.	0
968	PENCE	Well, he never said that, Senator.	0
969	KAINE	He absolutely said it.	0
970	KAINE	Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.	0
971	PENCE	Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.	0
972	QUIJANO	Gentlemen, Russia.	0
973	QUIJANO	Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime.	0
974	QUIJANO	What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?	0
975	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
976	KAINE	You've got to be tough on Russia.	0
977	KAINE	So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.	0
978	KAINE	Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.	0
979	KAINE	And Donald Trump has business...	0
980	PENCE	No, we haven't.	0
981	KAINE	has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.	0
982	KAINE	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.	0
983	KAINE	She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.	0
984	KAINE	She's had the experience doing it.	0
985	KAINE	She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.	0
986	KAINE	And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.	0
987	KAINE	Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.	0
988	PENCE	Oh, that's nonsense.	0
989	KAINE	He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, "I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."	0
990	KAINE	And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.	0
991	PENCE	He knew that.	0
992	KAINE	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.	0
993	KAINE	She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.	0
994	KAINE	And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.	0
995	KAINE	You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.	0
996	KAINE	On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time.	0
997	KAINE	America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason.	0
998	KAINE	They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?	0
999	KAINE	Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do.	0
1000	KAINE	And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...	0
1001	PENCE	But what's it got to do with Russia?	0
1002	KAINE	Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia.	0
1003	KAINE	The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...	0
1004	PENCE	No, he hasn't said that.	0
1005	KAINE	He has, actually.	0
1006	QUIJANO	Senator, your time is up.	0
1007	QUIJANO	Governor?	0
1008	PENCE	Well, thanks.	0
1009	PENCE	I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.	0
1010	KAINE	You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.	0
1011	PENCE	Yeah.	0
1012	KAINE	And I know you can't defend.	0
1013	QUIJANO	Senator, please.	0
1014	QUIJANO	This is the governor's two minutes.	0
1015	PENCE	I'm happy to defend him, Senator.	0
1016	PENCE	Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.	0
1017	KAINE	You're not.	0
1018	PENCE	I'm happy to defend him.	0
1019	PENCE	Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.	0
1020	KAINE	I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...	0
1021	PENCE	This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.	0
1022	QUIJANO	Senator, please.	0
1023	QUIJANO	This is Governor Pence's two minutes.	0
1024	PENCE	Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality.	0
1025	PENCE	Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.	0
1026	PENCE	That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula.	0
1027	PENCE	Donald Trump knew that happened.	0
1028	PENCE	He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.	0
1029	PENCE	The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.	0
1030	PENCE	And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding.	0
1031	PENCE	You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.	0
1032	PENCE	ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.	0
1033	PENCE	It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure.	0
1034	PENCE	I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...	0
1035	KAINE	We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.	0
1036	PENCE	on the day that Iran released four American hostages...	0
1037	KAINE	We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.	0
1038	QUIJANO	Governor...	0
1039	PENCE	we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.	0
1040	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1041	QUIJANO	Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...	0
1042	KAINE	And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.	0
1043	QUIJANO	quote, "Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."	0
1044	QUIJANO	Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?	0
1045	PENCE	Strength.	0
1046	PENCE	Plain and simple.	0
1047	KAINE	Business dealings.	0
1048	PENCE	Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.	0
1049	PENCE	Donald Trump is a strong leader...	0
1050	KAINE	Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...	0
1051	PENCE	who is going to lead with American strength.	0
1052	QUIJANO	Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.	0
1053	PENCE	We're going to rebuild our military.	0
1054	PENCE	And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.	0
1055	PENCE	Look, America is stronger than Russia.	0
1056	PENCE	Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.	0
1057	PENCE	America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.	0
1058	PENCE	When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.	0
1059	PENCE	That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.	0
1060	PENCE	That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...	0
1061	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
1062	PENCE	of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.	0
1063	KAINE	Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.	0
1064	KAINE	But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.	1
1065	PENCE	That is absolutely inaccurate.	0
1066	KAINE	And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...	0
1067	PENCE	He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.	0
1068	KAINE	No, he said leader.	0
1069	KAINE	And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor.	0
1070	PENCE	You just said better.	0
1071	KAINE	If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...	0
1072	PENCE	Yeah, here we go.	0
1073	PENCE	This is the grade school thing again?	0
1074	KAINE	persecuting journalists...	0
1075	PENCE	Right, this is grade school.	0
1076	KAINE	if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.	0
1077	PENCE	Yeah.	0
1078	KAINE	And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.	0
1079	KAINE	Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.	0
1080	KAINE	Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.	0
1081	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?	0
1082	KAINE	Vladimir Putin.	0
1083	KAINE	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.	0
1084	QUIJANO	And what would do you differently?	0
1085	KAINE	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.	0
1086	KAINE	He's not a leader.	0
1087	KAINE	Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.	0
1088	KAINE	Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.	0
1089	KAINE	John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB.	0
1090	KAINE	And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.	0
1091	PENCE	Right.	0
1092	KAINE	So how do deal with him?	0
1093	KAINE	You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.	0
1094	KAINE	There are areas where we can cooperate.	0
1095	KAINE	So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.	0
1096	KAINE	It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.	0
1097	KAINE	She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.	0
1098	KAINE	But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.	0
1099	KAINE	This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.	0
1100	QUIJANO	All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons.	0
1101	QUIJANO	North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.	0
1102	PENCE	Right.	0
1103	QUIJANO	What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?	0
1104	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
1105	PENCE	Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.	0
1106	PENCE	And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.	0
1107	PENCE	It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.	0
1108	PENCE	And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.	0
1109	PENCE	We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.	0
1110	PENCE	But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up.	0
1111	PENCE	It must have -- must have...	0
1112	KAINE	Until he...	0
1113	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1114	PENCE	done well in some focus group.	0
1115	PENCE	But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.	0
1116	PENCE	While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.	0
1117	PENCE	Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.	0
1118	PENCE	Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.	0
1119	PENCE	They cannot make financial contributions.	0
1120	PENCE	But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.	0
1121	PENCE	And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.	0
1122	PENCE	When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...	0
1123	QUIJANO	Governor, your two minutes are up.	0
1124	PENCE	the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...	0
1125	QUIJANO	Governor, please.	0
1126	PENCE	while she's secretary of state.	0
1127	QUIJANO	Your two minutes are up, Governor.	0
1128	PENCE	And they're saying enough is enough.	0
1129	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
1130	KAINE	I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea.	0
1131	KAINE	So, on the foundation.	0
1132	KAINE	I am glad to talk about the foundation.	0
1133	KAINE	The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.	0
1134	KAINE	It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.	0
1135	KAINE	It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.	0
1136	KAINE	It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.	0
1137	KAINE	The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.	0
1138	KAINE	Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.	0
1139	KAINE	The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.	0
1140	KAINE	So the foundation does good work.	0
1141	KAINE	And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.	0
1142	KAINE	But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.	0
1143	KAINE	The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.	0
1144	KAINE	He's refused to do it.	0
1145	KAINE	His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.	0
1146	KAINE	And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.	0
1147	KAINE	It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.	0
1148	PENCE	The Trump Foundation is non-profit.	0
1149	KAINE	In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.	0
1150	KAINE	The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.	0
1151	KAINE	They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.	0
1152	KAINE	And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.	0
1153	KAINE	This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.	0
1154	QUIJANO	Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.	0
1155	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1156	PENCE	Well, Thank you.	0
1157	PENCE	Thank you.	0
1158	PENCE	The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.	0
1159	PENCE	They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.	0
1160	KAINE	Political contributions?	0
1161	PENCE	Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.	0
1162	KAINE	A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?	0
1163	PENCE	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.	1
1164	KAINE	Ninety percent.	0
1165	PENCE	It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.	0
1166	PENCE	But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...	1
1167	QUIJANO	All right, let's turn back to North Korea...	0
1168	PENCE	that she refused to turn over in her private server...	0
1169	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine...	0
1170	PENCE	and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.	0
1171	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?	0
1172	KAINE	If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.	0
1173	KAINE	You have to.	0
1174	KAINE	A president has to do that.	0
1175	KAINE	Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.	0
1176	KAINE	You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.	0
1177	KAINE	I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0
1178	KAINE	We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.	0
1179	KAINE	And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.	0
1180	KAINE	Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.	0
1181	KAINE	They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.	0
1182	KAINE	So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.	0
1183	KAINE	So we're working together with China, and we need to.	0
1184	KAINE	China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.	0
1185	KAINE	Hillary understands that very well.	0
1186	KAINE	She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, "Women's rights are human rights."	0
1187	KAINE	They didn't want her to say that, but she did.	0
1188	KAINE	But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.	0
1189	KAINE	And that's what it's going to take.	0
1190	KAINE	The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.	0
1191	KAINE	I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.	0
1192	QUIJANO	All right.	0
1193	QUIJANO	I'd like to turn to our next segment now.	0
1194	QUIJANO	And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.	0
1195	QUIJANO	You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.	0
1196	QUIJANO	Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?	0
1197	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?	0
1198	KAINE	Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.	0
1199	KAINE	It's an easy one.	0
1200	KAINE	I'm really fortunate.	0
1201	KAINE	I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.	0
1202	KAINE	My mom and dad are sitting right here.	0
1203	KAINE	I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.	0
1204	KAINE	My 40th reunion is in 10 days.	0
1205	KAINE	And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.	0
1206	KAINE	I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.	0
1207	KAINE	But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.	0
1208	KAINE	For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.	0
1209	KAINE	But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.	0
1210	KAINE	And so I had to grapple with that.	0
1211	KAINE	When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.	0
1212	KAINE	But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.	0
1213	KAINE	I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.	0
1214	KAINE	And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.	0
1215	KAINE	And I was elected, and I did.	0
1216	KAINE	It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.	0
1217	KAINE	That was a real struggle.	0
1218	KAINE	But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.	0
1219	QUIJANO	Governor Pence?	0
1220	PENCE	Well, it's a wonderful question.	0
1221	PENCE	And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.	0
1222	PENCE	I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.	0
1223	PENCE	It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.	0
1224	PENCE	But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.	0
1225	PENCE	And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.	0
1226	PENCE	And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.	0
1227	PENCE	And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.	0
1228	PENCE	I truly do.	0
1229	KAINE	That's shared.	0
1230	PENCE	But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.	0
1231	PENCE	The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.	0
1232	PENCE	I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.	0
1233	PENCE	I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.	0
1234	PENCE	But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.	1
1235	PENCE	I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.	0
1236	PENCE	And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.	0
1237	PENCE	Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.	0
1238	PENCE	But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.	0
1239	PENCE	So for me, my faith informs my life.	0
1240	PENCE	I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.	0
1241	PENCE	But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.	0
1242	KAINE	Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.	0
1243	KAINE	Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.	0
1244	KAINE	But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.	0
1245	KAINE	But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.	0
1246	KAINE	So let's talk about abortion and choice.	0
1247	KAINE	Let's talk about them.	0
1248	KAINE	We support Roe v. Wade.	0
1249	KAINE	We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.	0
1250	KAINE	That's something we trust American women to do that.	0
1251	KAINE	And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.	0
1252	KAINE	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.	0
1253	KAINE	He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.	0
1254	KAINE	And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.	0
1255	KAINE	This is pretty important.	0
1256	KAINE	Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.	0
1257	KAINE	I think you should live your moral values.	0
1258	KAINE	But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.	0
1259	KAINE	And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.	0
1260	PENCE	No, it's really not.	0
1261	PENCE	Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.	0
1262	KAINE	Then why did Donald Trump say that?	0
1263	PENCE	We just never would.	0
1264	KAINE	Why did he say that?	0
1265	PENCE	Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.	0
1266	PENCE	And so...	0
1267	KAINE	Well, I would admit that's not a polished...	0
1268	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1269	PENCE	You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.	0
1270	KAINE	Well, can I say...	0
1271	PENCE	But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.	0
1272	KAINE	Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.	0
1273	KAINE	From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.	0
1274	PENCE	Yeah.	0
1275	KAINE	When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...	0
1276	PENCE	I'm telling you...	0
1277	KAINE	or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.	0
1278	PENCE	Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again.	0
1279	PENCE	He -- look...	0
1280	KAINE	Can you defend it?	0
1281	PENCE	There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.	0
1282	KAINE	You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?	0
1283	PENCE	He also said and many of them are good people.	0
1284	PENCE	You keep leaving that out of your quote.	0
1285	PENCE	And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.	0
1286	PENCE	But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life.	0
1287	PENCE	I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.	0
1288	PENCE	It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.	0
1289	PENCE	And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.	0
1290	PENCE	People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.	0
1291	PENCE	We can create a culture of life.	0
1292	PENCE	More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.	0
1293	PENCE	We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...	0
1294	KAINE	This is important --	0
1295	PENCE	bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.	0
1296	PENCE	There are so many families around the country who can't have children.	0
1297	PENCE	We could improve adoption...	0
1298	KAINE	But, Governor...	0
1299	PENCE	so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.	0
1300	KAINE	Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?	0
1301	KAINE	We can encourage people to support life.	0
1302	KAINE	Of course we can.	0
1303	KAINE	But why don't you trust women?	0
1304	KAINE	Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?	0
1305	KAINE	That's what we ought to be doing in public life.	0
1306	KAINE	Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...	0
1307	PENCE	Because there are...	0
1308	KAINE	but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.	0
1309	PENCE	Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.	0
1310	PENCE	I believe it with all my heart.	0
1311	PENCE	And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.	0
1312	QUIJANO	I do have one final question for you both tonight.	0
1313	QUIJANO	It has been a divisive campaign.	0
1314	QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?	0
1315	KAINE	That's a really important one.	0
1316	KAINE	That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.	0
1317	KAINE	And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.	0
1318	KAINE	But we do have to bring the country together.	0
1319	KAINE	So here's what we'll do.	0
1320	KAINE	Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.	0
1321	KAINE	And I served in the Senate.	0
1322	KAINE	And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.	0
1323	KAINE	She was on the Armed Services Committee.	0
1324	KAINE	She was on other committees.	0
1325	KAINE	She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.	0
1326	KAINE	She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.	0
1327	KAINE	She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.	0
1328	KAINE	She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.	0
1329	KAINE	And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.	0
1330	KAINE	I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.	0
1331	KAINE	And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.	0
1332	KAINE	Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.	0
1333	KAINE	And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.	0
1334	QUIJANO	Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?	0
1335	PENCE	Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...	0
1336	KAINE	Absolutely.	0
1337	PENCE	tonight.	0
1338	PENCE	Thank you, Senator.	0
1339	PENCE	This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.	0
1340	PENCE	Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.	0
1341	PENCE	I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.	0
1342	PENCE	You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.	0
1343	PENCE	And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill.	0
1344	PENCE	The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.	0
1345	PENCE	The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.	0
1346	PENCE	They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.	0
1347	PENCE	They want to see an American comeback.	0
1348	PENCE	And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.	0
1349	PENCE	It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.	0
1350	PENCE	When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.	0
1351	PENCE	They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.	0
1352	PENCE	And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.	0
1353	QUIJANO	All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.	0
1354	QUIJANO	This concludes the vice presidential debate.	0
1355	QUIJANO	My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching.	0
1356	QUIJANO	Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0
1357	QUIJANO	From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News.	0
1358	QUIJANO	Good night.	0
